#### AUTO INCREMENT Field

Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.

Often this is the primary key field that we would like to be created automatically every time a new record is inserted.

#### Syntax for SQL Server

The following SQL statement defines the "Personid" column to be an auto-increment primary key field in the "Persons" table:

```
CREATE TABLE Persons (
    Personid int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
   LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
   FirstName varchar(255),
   Age int
);
```

The MS SQL Server uses the IDENTITY keyword to perform an auto-increment feature.

In the example above, the starting value for IDENTITY is 1, and it will increment by 1 for each new record.

Tip: To specify that the "Personid" column should start at value 10 and increment by 5, change it to IDENTITY(10,5).

To insert a new record into the "Persons" table, we will NOT have to specify a value for the "Personid" column (a unique value will be added automatically):

INSERT INTO Persons (FirstName,LastName)
VALUES ('Mohammed','Abu-Hadhoud');

The SQL statement above would insert a new record into the "Persons" table. The "Personid" column would be assigned a unique value. The "FirstName" column would be set to "Mohammed" and the "LastName" column would be set to "Abu-Hadhoud".
