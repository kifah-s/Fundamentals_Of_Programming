#### SQL DROP DATABASE Statement

In SQL, DROP DATABASE is used to delete the database in our Database Management System. For example,

```sql
DROP DATABASE koko;
```

Here, the SQL command will delete a database named koko.

Also make sure you have admin or DROP permission to run this command.

Note: When we delete a database, all tables and records within a database are also deleted.
