## Lesson Summary.

#### SQL CREATE INDEX Statement

The CREATE INDEX statement is used to create indexes in tables.

Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.

Note: Updating a table with indexes takes more time than updating a table without (because the indexes also need an update). So, only create indexes on columns that will be frequently searched against.

CREATE INDEX Syntax
Creates an index on a table. Duplicate values are allowed:
```
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX Syntax
Creates a unique index on a table. Duplicate values are not allowed:
```
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

#### CREATE INDEX Example

The SQL statement below creates an index named "idx_lastname" on the "LastName" column in the "Persons" table:
```
CREATE INDEX idx_lastname
ON Persons (LastName);
```

If you want to create an index on a combination of columns, you can list the column names within the parentheses, separated by commas:
```
CREATE INDEX idx_pname
ON Persons (LastName, FirstName);
```

#### DROP INDEX Statement

The DROP INDEX statement is used to delete an index in a table.
```
DROP INDEX table_name.index_name;
```

#### SQL Server Clustered Index and Primary key constraint

When you create a table with a primary key, SQL Server automatically creates a corresponding clustered index that includes primary key columns.



Clustered Index is much faster than normal Index.
