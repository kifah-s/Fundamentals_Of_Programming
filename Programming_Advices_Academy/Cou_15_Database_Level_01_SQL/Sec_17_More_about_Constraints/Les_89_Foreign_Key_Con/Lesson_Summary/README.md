#### SQL FOREIGN KEY Constraint

The FOREIGN KEY constraint is used to prevent actions that would destroy links between tables.

A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.

---

#### SQL FOREIGN KEY on CREATE TABLE

The following SQL creates a FOREIGN KEY on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is created:
```
CREATE TABLE Orders (
   OrderID int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
   OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
   PersonID int FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
```

To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:

```
CREATE TABLE Orders (
   OrderID int NOT NULL,
   OrderNumber int NOT NULL,
   PersonID int,
   PRIMARY KEY (OrderID),
   CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder FOREIGN KEY (PersonID)
   REFERENCES Persons(PersonID)
);
```
---

#### SQL FOREIGN KEY on ALTER TABLE

To create a FOREIGN KEY constraint on the "PersonID" column when the "Orders" table is already created, use the following SQL:
```
ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);
```

To allow naming of a FOREIGN KEY constraint, and for defining a FOREIGN KEY constraint on multiple columns, use the following SQL syntax:
```
ALTER TABLE Orders
ADD CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder
FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Persons(PersonID);
```

---

#### DROP a FOREIGN KEY Constraint

To drop a FOREIGN KEY constraint, use the following SQL:
```
ALTER TABLE Orders
DROP CONSTRAINT FK_PersonOrder;
```
