In C++, both `\n` and `endl` are used to **create a new line**, but there is an important difference in **behavior and performance**.

### ✅ **Difference Between `\n` and `endl`:**

| Item                  | `\n`                        | `endl`                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Function**          | Inserts a new line          | Inserts a new line                 |
| **Additional Effect** | Does nothing else           | Also **flushes the output buffer** |
| **Performance**       | Faster                      | Slower (due to flushing)           |
| **Preferred Use**     | When flushing is not needed | When you need immediate output     |

### 💡 **Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello\n";
    cout << "World" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
Hello
World
```

### ⚠️ When to use `endl`?

- When you want to **force the program to immediately display the output** (e.g., in interactive apps or debugging).

### ⚠️ When to use `\n`?

- When you're concerned about performance or printing a lot of output without needing immediate display.

In **C++**, a **"Buffer"** refers to a **temporary memory area** where data is stored **temporarily before being sent or received**.

### ✅ **What is a Buffer?**

- A **temporary space in memory (RAM)** used to hold data while it's being transferred between two parts of a program, or between the program and the system (like a hard drive, screen, or network).
- It helps **improve performance** by reducing the number of direct interactions with devices or the operating system.

### 🔄 **Usage in C++:**

#### 1. **Buffered Output:**

- When using `cout` or `ofstream`, the data is **not printed or written immediately**.
- Instead, it is first stored in a **buffer**, and then displayed/written when:

  - The buffer is full
  - You use `endl` (which flushes the buffer)
  - You use `flush`
  - Or when the program ends

#### 2. **Buffered Input:**

- When reading input using `cin`, the data may also be **temporarily stored in a buffer** before being processed.

### 💡 **Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello";   // Not immediately printed; stored in the buffer
    // No endl or flush used
    return 0;          // Buffer is automatically flushed before program ends
}
```

#### If you write:

```cpp
cout << "Hello" << endl; // Immediately printed because endl flushes the buffer
```

### 📌 **Flushing the Buffer:**

- Means **sending the stored data from the buffer to its destination** (screen, file, network, etc.).

### 🛠️ **Manual buffer flush:**

```cpp
cout << flush;
```

### ⚠️ Why use buffering?

- To reduce the number of expensive input/output operations.
- To improve performance and efficiency.
