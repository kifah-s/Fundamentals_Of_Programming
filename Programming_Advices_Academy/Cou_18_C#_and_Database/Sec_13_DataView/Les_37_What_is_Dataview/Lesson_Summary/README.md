## Lesson Summary.

In C#, both DataView and DataTable are classes provided by the .NET Framework for working with tabular data. While they serve similar purposes, there are some differences between them, and the choice between DataView and DataTable depends on your specific requirements. Here are a few reasons why you might choose to use DataView over DataTable:

1. Data Manipulation: DataView provides more flexible and efficient data manipulation capabilities compared to DataTable. It allows you to apply filters, sort and search data, and perform custom data projections using LINQ queries. These operations are often more convenient and performant with DataView.

2. Lightweight: DataView is a lightweight wrapper around a DataTable that provides a read-only, customized view of the data. It does not duplicate the underlying data but instead provides a flexible way to access and manipulate it. If you only need to query or display data without making any modifications, using DataView can be more memory-efficient.

3. Sorting and Filtering: DataView makes it easy to sort and filter data using its built-in functionalities. You can specify multiple sort criteria, apply complex filters using expressions, and even create custom views based on specific criteria. DataTable also supports sorting and filtering, but DataView provides a more convenient and expressive syntax for these operations.

4. Data Binding: If you are working with data binding scenarios, DataView provides more control and flexibility. It allows you to bind the view to UI controls and automatically update the display when the underlying data changes. DataTable can also be bound to controls, but DataView offers more advanced features in this regard.

5. Performance: In some cases, DataView can offer better performance compared to DataTable. Since DataView provides a customized view of the data, it can optimize operations like filtering and sorting, resulting in faster execution times. If you frequently perform these operations on large datasets, DataView might provide better performance.

However, it's worth noting that DataTable has its advantages as well. It is a more robust and comprehensive data structure that can hold multiple tables, enforce constraints, and support more complex data operations. If you require these advanced features or need to perform extensive modifications to the data structure itself, DataTable might be a better choice.

In summary, DataView is generally preferred when you need a lightweight, customizable view of data for querying, sorting, and filtering, while DataTable is suitable for scenarios that involve complex data operations, constraints, and multiple tables.
