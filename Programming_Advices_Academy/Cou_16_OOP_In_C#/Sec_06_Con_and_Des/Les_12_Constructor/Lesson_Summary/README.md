## Lesson Summary.

#### C# Constructor

In C#, a constructor is similar to a method that is invoked when an object of the class is created.

However, unlike methods, a constructor:

- has the same name as that of the class
- does not have any return type

#### Create a C# constructor

Here's how we create a constructor in C#
```
class clsPerson
{  
  // constructor
  clsPerson()
  {
    //code
  }
}
```

Here, clsPerson() is a constructor. It has the same name as its class.

Call a constructor

Once we create a constructor, we can call it using the new keyword. For example,
```
new clsPerson();
```

In C#, a constructor is called when we try to create an object of a class. For example,
```
clsPerson Person1 = new clsPerson();
```

Here, we are calling the clsPerson() constructor to create an object Person1.
