#### C# Enums

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable/read-only variables).

To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the enum items with a comma:

Example
```
enum Level 
{
  Low,
  Medium,
  High
}
```

You can access enum items with the dot syntax:
```
Level myVar = Level.Medium;
Console.WriteLine(myVar);
```

Enum is short for "enumerations", which means "specifically listed".

Enum inside a Class
You can also have an enum inside a class:

Example
```
class Program
{
  enum Level
  {
    Low,
    Medium,
    High
  }

  static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    Level myVar = Level.Medium;
    Console.WriteLine(myVar);
  }
}
```
