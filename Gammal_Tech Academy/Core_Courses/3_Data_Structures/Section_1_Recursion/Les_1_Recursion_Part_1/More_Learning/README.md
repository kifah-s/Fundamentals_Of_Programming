**INFO 1: "Recursion"**

"Recursion in computer science refers to the use of a function (or procedure) within itself during program execution. This means that the function calls itself, and recursion is considered a powerful concept useful for solving a variety of problems.

In programming, recursion can be used to analyze problems that can be divided into smaller instances of the same problem. When a function performs self-calling, it creates a "chain" of functions returning to the original function. This chain is executed by adding a frame for each function call on the "stack."

For example, here is a simple function that calculates the number of elements in a sequence recursively:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int recursiveCount(int n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        // Recursive call
        return 1 + recursiveCount(n - 1);
    }
}

int main() {
    int result = recursiveCount(5);
    std::cout << "Number of elements: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `recursiveCount` function performs self-calling, dividing the problem (counting the number of elements) into smaller problems recursively until it reaches the base case (when `n` is equal to 0)." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Recursion - Advantages And Disadvantages"**

"Recursion - Advantages And Disadvantages:

### Advantages:

1. **Elegant Design and Better Understanding:**

   - Recursion can be used to design an elegant and understandable solution for problems that naturally fit the recursive nature of the problem.

2. **Ability to Solve Complex Problems:**

   - Recursion can be beneficial for solving problems that require breaking them down into smaller tasks, making them easier to understand and implement.

3. **Avoidance of Code Repetition:**
   - In some cases, recursion can be used to avoid code repetition and increase code reuse.

### Disadvantages:

1. **Memory Consumption:**

   - Using recursion may lead to the formation of a long chain of function calls on the memory stack, and in some cases, this can result in significant memory consumption.

2. **Less Efficient Performance:**

   - In some cases, the performance may be less efficient compared to non-recursive solutions, especially in programs that require high efficiency.

3. **Risk of Infinite Recursion:**

   - It's crucial to ensure a good base case condition in the recursive function to avoid infinite recursion, which could lead to program freezing.

4. **Impact on Performance:**
   - Recursion may have a negative impact on performance in some cases due to the additional cost associated with storing the function call stack and managing the calling and returning processes.

In conclusion, the use of recursion depends on the nature of the problem and performance requirements. In some cases, recursion can be an effective tool, while in other cases, it may have a negative impact." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 3: "stack"**

"In computer science, the term "stack" refers to a data structure used for organizing data and controlling program execution. A stack has a specific method for storing and accessing data called "Last In, First Out" or "LIFO," meaning that the last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

### Key Features of a Stack:

1. **Last In, First Out (LIFO):**

   - The last item added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

2. **Basic Operations:**

   - `Push`: To add an element to the stack.
   - `Pop`: To remove an element from the stack.
   - `Peek` or `Top`: To look at the last added element without removing it.

3. **Main Uses:**

   - Stacks are used in various contexts, including managing function calls (call and return), managing program memory (allocation and deallocation), and solutions to mathematical problems like sequences and traversals.

4. **Hardware-Level Execution:**
   - Stacks are typically implemented at the hardware level, where it has a pointer indicating the top element in the stack.

### Simple Example:

For example, let's assume we have a stack containing numbers and perform `Push` and `Pop` operations:

1. `Push(10)`: Adds the number 10 to the stack.
2. `Push(20)`: Adds the number 20.
3. `Push(30)`: Adds the number 30.

At this point, the stack looks like this:

```
30  <-- Top
20
10  <-- Bottom
```

4. `Pop()`: Removes the number 30.

Now the stack looks like this:

```
20  <-- Top
10  <-- Bottom
```

This follows the LIFO principle followed by a stack." **(ChatGPT)**
