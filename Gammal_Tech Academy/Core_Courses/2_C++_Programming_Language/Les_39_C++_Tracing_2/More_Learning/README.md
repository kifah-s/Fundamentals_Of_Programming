**INFO_1 : "Recursion"**

"In programming, the term "Recursion" refers to the use of a function that calls itself, meaning the function invokes itself during its execution. This allows the function to solve a specific problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar tasks.

Handling recursion involves specifying a base case, which determines when the function should stop self-calling to avoid an infinite loop. Recursion is commonly used to solve problems that exhibit repetitive structures.

Dealing with recursion typically involves defining a base case that specifies when the function should stop calling itself. Recursion is often used to solve problems with a repetitive structure.

A simple example of recursion is calculating the factorial, where the factorial can be calculated using the following relationship:

\[ n! = n \times (n-1)! \]

Here, \(n!\) is the factorial of the number \(n\), and the calculation stops at \(1! = 1\) (the base case).

Recursion is widely used in programming, but it should be used carefully to avoid infinite loops and ensure efficient performance." **(ChatGPT)**
