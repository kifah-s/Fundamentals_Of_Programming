**INFO_1 : "Generic programming"**

"**Generic programming is a style of programming that uses generic data types, instead of specific data types. These generic types allow you to write code that can be used with any data type, making it more efficient and reusable.**

**For example, let's say you want to write a program to sort a list of numbers. You could write a generic sorting function that can handle any numeric data type, like:**

```python
def sort(list: List[T]) -> List[T]:
    for i in range(len(list)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(list)):
            if list[i] > list[j]:
                list[i], list[j] = list[j], list[i]

    return list
```

**This function works by comparing each pair of elements in the list, and swapping their positions if the first value is greater than the second value. This function can be used with any numeric data type, like integers, floating-point numbers, or fractions.**

**Here is an example of how to use this function:**

```python
numbers = [1, 5, 3, 2, 4]
sorted_numbers = sort(numbers)

print(sorted_numbers)
```

**This code will print the following numbers:**

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Generic programming is useful in many cases, such as:**

- When you need to write code that can be used with different data types.
- When you need to write reusable code.
- When you need to write more efficient code.

**Here are some other examples of generic programming:**

- Templates in the C++ programming language.
- Generic classes in the Java programming language.
- Generic interfaces in the C# programming language.

**I hope this explanation helps!**" **(Google Bard)**

**INFO_2 : "Generic programming"**

"Generic programming is an approach in programming aimed at writing reusable and type-independent code. It allows programmers to create software structures that can work with a variety of types without having to rewrite the code for each type individually.

In generic programming, the main idea is to use templates, which define type or function templates rather than specifying a fixed data type. These templates allow for code to be reused with a wide range of types without rewriting the same code.

The advantages of generic programming include:
- Code Reusability: You can use the same code to handle a variety of types without repetition.
- Safer Code: Errors can be detected at compile time, reducing runtime errors.
- Better Efficiency: Optimized code can be generated for each type.

A simple example of generic programming in C++ is using templates to create generic data structures like `std::vector`, which can be used with a variety of types.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template <typename T>

void printVector(const std::vector<T>& vec)
{
    for (const T& item : vec)
    {
        std::cout << item << " ";
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> intVector = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::vector<std::string> strVector = {"Hello", "World"};

    printVector(intVector); // Works with an array of integers
    printVector(strVector); // Works with an array of strings
    return 0;
}
```

This is a simple example that uses templates to create the `printVector` function capable of printing arrays regardless of the type of elements within them." **(ChatGPT)**
