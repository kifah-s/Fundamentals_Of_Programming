**INFO_1 : "`string` data type.."**

"The `std::string` data type in the C++ programming language is used to represent text strings, and it is one of the very useful data types. Text strings can be enclosed in double quotes (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`) or even empty strings (`""`).

Here are some examples of how to use `std::string`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    // Define a string and initialize it with a value
    std::string greeting = "Hello, World!";

    // Output the value of the string
    std::cout << greeting << std::endl;

    // Strings can be manipulated like primitive types
    std::string name = "Alice";
    std::string message = "Hello, " + name + "!";

    // Print the greeting message
    std::cout << message << std::endl;

    // Use std::string functions for operations like length and comparison
    if (greeting.length() > message.length())
    {
        std::cout << "The greeting is longer." << std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout << "The message is longer." << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

With `std::string`, you can easily create, modify, and process text strings, including operations such as substring extraction, concatenation, character extraction, and more. This makes it useful for most text processing, input, and output tasks in C++." **(ChatGPT)**
