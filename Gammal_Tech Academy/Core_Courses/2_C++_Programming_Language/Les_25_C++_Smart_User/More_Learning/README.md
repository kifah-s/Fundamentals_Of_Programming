**INFO_1 : "`char(10)`"**

In the C++ programming language, the following code `char(10);` creates a character variable and assigns it the value 10.

- `char()`: This is the constructor for the `char` data type.
- `10`: This is the number that will be assigned to the variable.

In C++, characters are represented as symbolic numbers. The number 10 corresponds to the character `\n`, which is the newline character.

Therefore, the code `char(10);` will create a character variable named `x` and assign it the value `\n`.

Here is an example of how to use this code:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  char x(10);
  std::cout << x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

This code will print the following line:

```

```

On some systems, the code `char(10);` may be translated to `char('\n');`. This is the same meaning, but it is more explicit because it uses a special character instead of a number.

I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have any other questions." **(Google Bard)**
