**INFO_1 : "class"**

In the C++ programming language, a class is a type of data that allows us to create specific models of real or abstract things. A class provides a way to organize data and functions related to it together.

In simple terms, we can say that a class is a template that we use to create objects. An object is an instance of a class.

Here is an example of how to create a class:

```c++
class Person
{
 public:
  // Attributes
  std::string name;
  int age;

  // Functions
  void say_hello()
  {
    std::cout << "Hello, my name is " << name << std::endl;
  }
};
```

In this example, we created a class called `Person`. This class has attributes for name and age. It also has a function called `say_hello()`.

We can create an object from the class using the keyword `new`:

```c++
Person* person = new Person();
```

This code will create a new object from the class `Person`. We can then access the object's attributes and functions using the asterisk (\*):

```c++
person->name = "Bard";
person->age = 25;
person->say_hello();
```

This code will set the object's name to "Bard" and the object's age to 25. It will also call the `say_hello()` function.

Here are some of the main advantages of classes in C++:

- **Reusability:** We can use classes to reuse code.
- **Organization:** Classes help organize code.
- **Encapsulation:** Classes help hide implementation details.

I hope this explanation is helpful." **(Google Bard)**

**INFO_2 : "class"**

"Hello! I'm doing well, thank you. I hope you're doing well too. Of course, I can explain the concept of a "class" in the C++ programming language in a simplified manner.

A "class" is a fundamental structure in C++ used to create organized and reusable code. You can think of a "class" as a custom data type that holds data and functions (methods) associated with it.

Here's a simple example to illustrate the concept of a "class":

```cpp
class Car
{
public:
    // Data members (attributes)
    string make;
    string model;
    int year;

    // Member functions (methods)
    void startEngine()
    {
        cout << "The car has started!" << endl;
    }

    void stopEngine()
    {
        cout << "The car has stopped!" << endl;
    }
};
```

In this example, a "class" named "Car" is created, which has properties (data) such as "make," "model," and "year," along with functions (methods) like "startEngine" and "stopEngine" that can be called to perform specific actions.

When you create an instance of this "class," you can easily access its data and use the associated functions. For example:

```cpp
Car myCar; // Create a new instance of the "Car" class
myCar.make = "Toyota";
myCar.model = "Camry";
myCar.year = 2022;

myCar.startEngine(); // Start the engine
```

This is a simple concept of a "class" in C++, and it can be used to organize and encapsulate data and functions in your code in a structured manner." **(ChatGPT)**
