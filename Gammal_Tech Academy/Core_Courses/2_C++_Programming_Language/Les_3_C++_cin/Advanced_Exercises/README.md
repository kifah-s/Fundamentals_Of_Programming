1 : Calculator software for geniuses ...

When using a traditional calculator, you read two numbers, perform a specific mathematical operation on them, and print the result. But usually geniuses like to test their mental abilities before knowing the final result.  

Required: Create a calculator program when the user enters numbers and the type of calculation. The program asks the user about the result. If the result is correct, it prints (“You are a genius”) and then prints the result. If the result is wrong, it prints ("Good Luck Next Time") then prints the result.
