**INFO_1 : "`static`"**

"In the C++ programming language, `static` is a qualifier that can be used to modify the behavior and meaning of various elements, including variables, functions, and class members. Here are the primary uses of `static`:

1. **Static Variables:** When a variable is defined as `static` within a certain scope (e.g., inside a function), it is stored in memory only once, regardless of how many times the scope is invoked. This is commonly used to retain values between different calls to the function.

2. **Static Functions:** When a function is defined as `static` within a class, it can be called without the need to create an object of the class. This means it belongs to the class itself rather than an object.

3. **Static Class Members:** Class members can be defined as `static`, allowing them to be shared among all class objects. This enables sharing information between different objects without the need for a separate copy of the member for each object.

4. **Static Local Variables:** When a local variable is defined as `static` within a function, it is stored in memory once and persists until the end of the program. This can be useful for maintaining a value between successive calls to the function.

In general, `static` is used to control the scope and lifetime of variables, functions, and class members. It provides a means to achieve sustainability and information sharing among different objects and program scopes." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO_2 : ""static" and "const""**

"The terms "static" and "const" are two different concepts in programming languages, and they serve different purposes and have distinct use cases:

1. **Static:**
   - `static` is used to modify the behavior of variables and functions in a program.
   - When used with a variable, it means that the value stored in the variable is shared among all instances, whether within the scope of a function or outside of it.
   - When used with a function inside a class, it means that the function belongs to the class itself and can be called without the need to create an instance of the class.
   - `static` can be used with class members (variables and functions) to share them among all objects created from the class.

2. **Const (Constant):**
   - `const` is used to create constants, which are values that cannot be changed after they are defined.
   - When used with a variable, it means that the value cannot be modified after it is assigned. It is a constant value.
   - When used with a function, it means that the function will not modify any variables within it, and the program does not expect them to change.
   - It is often used with pointers to indicate that the pointed-to variable is not allowed to be modified.

So, the main difference is that "static" relates to sharing and unit of operation, while "const" relates to immutability and stability. They can be used together in some cases, where you can define a `const static` variable to create a constant that is shared among all objects." **(ChatGPT)**
