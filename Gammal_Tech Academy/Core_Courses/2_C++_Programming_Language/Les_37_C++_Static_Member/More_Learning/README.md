**INFO_1 : "`static`"**

"In the C++ programming language, `static` is a qualifier that can be used to modify the behavior and meaning of various elements, including variables, functions, and class members. Here are the primary uses of `static`:

1. **Static Variables:** When a variable is defined as `static` within a certain scope (e.g., inside a function), it is stored in memory only once, regardless of how many times the scope is invoked. This is commonly used to retain values between different calls to the function.

2. **Static Functions:** When a function is defined as `static` within a class, it can be called without the need to create an object of the class. This means it belongs to the class itself rather than an object.

3. **Static Class Members:** Class members can be defined as `static`, allowing them to be shared among all class objects. This enables sharing information between different objects without the need for a separate copy of the member for each object.

4. **Static Local Variables:** When a local variable is defined as `static` within a function, it is stored in memory once and persists until the end of the program. This can be useful for maintaining a value between successive calls to the function.

In general, `static` is used to control the scope and lifetime of variables, functions, and class members. It provides a means to achieve sustainability and information sharing among different objects and program scopes." **(ChatGPT)**
