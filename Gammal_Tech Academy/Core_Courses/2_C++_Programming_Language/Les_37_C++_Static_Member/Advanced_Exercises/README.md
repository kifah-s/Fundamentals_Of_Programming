1 : Company bank account program:  
All companies have their own bank account, and there are several employees to control this account.  
The employee can add an amount, withdraw an amount, or display the value in the account.  
Required: Write a program that includes a class for a bank account, and each employee has the right to control it according to his position in the company.

2 : Create a class called "Counter" that has a static member variable "count" and two member functions "increment" and "getCount".  
The "increment" function should increment the "count" variable, and "getCount" should return the value of "count".  
Write a simple main function to test the "Counter" class by creating several objects and calling the "increment" function.

3 : Create a class called "BankAccount" that has a static member variable "interestRate" and two member variables "balance" and "accountNumber".  
The class should have a constructor that sets the initial balance and account number, and member functions "deposit" and "withdraw" to modify the balance.  
The "deposit" and "withdraw" functions should also update the balance based on the current "interestRate".  
The "interestRate" should be set using a static member function called "setInterestRate".  
Write a simple main function to test the "BankAccount" class by creating several objects and calling the member functions.

4 : Create a class called "Person" that has a static member variable "numberOfPeople" and two member variables "name" and "age".  
The class should have a constructor that sets the name and age, and a destructor that decrements the "numberOfPeople" variable.  
The "numberOfPeople" variable should be incremented in the constructor and decremented in the destructor.  
Write a simple main function to test the "Person" class by creating several objects and printing the current "numberOfPeople" value.
