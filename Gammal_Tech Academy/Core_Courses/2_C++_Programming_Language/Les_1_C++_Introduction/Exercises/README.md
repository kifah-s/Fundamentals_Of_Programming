# Exercises ..

1 : These exercises are like real projects that simulate real life. Each exercise from Real Life Problems can be a real project that people use. You are not only practicing programming, which you learned in the course. You are also learning how to think about what people need. You can use programming if you provide it to them.

2 : These exercises do not have a specific structure to follow in order to implement them, and this is to leave you room for creativity to reach the output in any way. So try it as much as you can...and remember that the intensity is a criterion for your understanding of programming, but this is just a way to simulate real life with programming.

3 : enjoy üòÑ‚úåÔ∏è.
