1 : Create a header file called "calculator.h" that defines a function called "addition" which takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. Write the implementation of this function in a separate file called "calculator.cpp". Use a main function in a separate file called "main.cpp" to call the "addition" function and print the result.
