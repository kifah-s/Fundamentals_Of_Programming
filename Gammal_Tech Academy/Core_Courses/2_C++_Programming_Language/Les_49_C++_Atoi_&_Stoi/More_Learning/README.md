**INFO_1 : "`atoi` function"**

"The `atoi` function in the C++ programming language is used to convert a string of characters (a text) into an integer value (`int`). The name `atoi` stands for "ASCII to Integer," as it is used to convert the ASCII representation of a number into an actual integer.

Here's a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

int main()
{
    const char *str = "12345";
    int num = std::atoi(str);

    std::cout << "Converted integer: " << num << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the string `"12345"` is converted into the integer `12345` using `atoi`. The array should point to a string of characters representing an integer, and if the string contains non-integer characters, the result is undefined.

It's worth noting that `atoi` is considered relatively old, and in modern C++, it's recommended to use functions tailored for converting a string to a specific type, such as `std::stoi` for converting to `int`." **(ChatGPT)**
