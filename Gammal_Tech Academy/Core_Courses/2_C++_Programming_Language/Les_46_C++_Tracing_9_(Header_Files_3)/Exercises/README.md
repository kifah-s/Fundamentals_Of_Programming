# Exercises ..

1 : Create a header file called "factorial.h" that defines a function called "calculate_factorial" which takes an integer value as an argument and returns the factorial of that value.  
Implement the function in a separate file called "factorial.cpp". Use a main function in a separate file called "main.cpp" to call the "calculate_factorial" function and print the result. 

2 : Create a header file called "array_operations.h" that defines a function called "find_sum" which takes an array of integers and its size as arguments, and returns the sum of all the elements in the array.  
Implement the function in a separate file called "array_operations.cpp". Use a main function in a separate file called "main.cpp" to create an array of integers, call the "find_sum" function and print the result.
