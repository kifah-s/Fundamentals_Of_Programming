**INFO_1 : "namespace"**

"In programming languages like C++ and C#, `namespace` is used to organize and group code in a hierarchical manner. It can be considered as a unit of organization for code that helps avoid conflicts between variable and function names in large programs and programming projects.

Here are some important points about `namespace`:

1. **Code Organization:**
   `namespace` can be used to organize code into logical groups. For example, if you have a graphics library, you can place all functions and types related to graphics inside a `namespace` dedicated to graphics.

   ```cpp
   namespace GraphicsLibrary
   {
       class Shape
       {
           // ...
       };

       void draw(Shape s)
       {
           // ...
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Avoiding Conflicts:**
   In large programming environments, there may be similar names in different places. Using `namespace` helps avoid conflicts between these names.

3. **Third-Party Code:**
   `namespace` can also be used to group code from external libraries or third-party code.

   ```cpp
   // In an external file (external library)
   namespace ExternalLibrary
   {
       void externalFunction()
       {
           // ...
       }
   }

   // In the main program
   int main()
   {
       ExternalLibrary::externalFunction();
       return 0;
   }
   ```

4. **Multiple Name Usage (Alias):**
   `namespace` can be used to give new names to variables or functions that may be defined in different places. This helps clarify the code and improve readability.

   ```cpp
   namespace MathLibrary
   {
       namespace Geometry
       {
           double calculateDistance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2)
           {
               // ...
           }
       }
   }

   // Define a new name for the calculation function
   using MathLibrary::Geometry::calculateDistance;

   // The new name can be used in the main program
   int main()
   {
       double distance = calculateDistance(0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0);
       return 0;
   }
   ```

Remember that using `namespace` effectively requires careful consideration to avoid naming complexities and increase code readability." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO_2 : "namespace"**

"**In programming, a namespace is a collection of names that can be used to refer to different things, such as variables, functions, classes, and modules.**

**Namespaces are used to avoid name conflicts between names with the same name in different namespaces. For example, if we have a variable named `my_variable` in two different namespaces, we can distinguish between them by adding the namespace name to the variable name. For example, we can use `my_namespace::my_variable` to refer to the variable `my_variable` in the namespace `my_namespace`.**

**Namespaces can be declared using the `namespace` keyword. For example, we can declare a namespace named `my_namespace` as follows:**

```c++
namespace my_namespace
{

  // Declare variables, functions, classes, and modules

}
```

**After declaring a namespace, we can use it by adding its name to the name of the thing we want to refer to. For example, we can use the following code to refer to the variable `my_variable` in the namespace `my_namespace`:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

namespace my_namespace
{
  int my_variable = 10;
}

int main()
{
  std::cout << my_namespace::my_variable << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

**This code will print the value `10` to the console.**

**Namespaces can also be used to organize code. For example, we can create a namespace for each module or class. This will help make the code more readable and understandable.**

**Here are some examples of how namespaces can be used:**

* **To avoid name conflicts:** If we have a variable named `my_variable` in two different namespaces, we can distinguish between them by adding the namespace name to the variable name.
* **To organize code:** We can create a namespace for each module or class. This will help make the code more readable and understandable.
* **To customize names:** We can use namespaces to customize names. For example, we can create a namespace named `my_company` to customize the names we use in our project.**

**I hope this helps.**" **(Google Bard)**
