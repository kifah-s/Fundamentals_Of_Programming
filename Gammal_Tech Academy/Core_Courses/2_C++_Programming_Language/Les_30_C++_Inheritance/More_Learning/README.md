**INFO_1 : "Inheritance"**

"**Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming**

Inheritance is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, and it allows you to create new classes by extending existing classes.

The basic idea behind inheritance is that you can create a new class that inherits all the properties and behaviors of another class. This means that you don't have to write the same code twice, which makes your code more reusable and easier to maintain.

For example, you could create a class called `Animal` that represents any animal. Then, you could create a subclass of `Animal` called `Dog`. `Dog` will inherit all the properties and behaviors of `Animal`, plus its own properties and behaviors.

Here is an example of how to use inheritance in the C# programming language:

```c#
// Animal class
public class Animal
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public void Speak()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The animal is speaking.");
    }
}

// Dog class
public class Dog : Animal
{
    public string Breed { get; set; }

    public void Bark()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The dog is barking.");
    }
}

// Create an object of the Dog class
Dog dog = new Dog();
dog.Name = "Rex";
dog.Age = 10;
dog.Breed = "Golden Retriever";

// Call the Speak() method
dog.Speak(); // Prints "The animal is speaking."

// Call the Bark() method
dog.Bark(); // Prints "The dog is barking."
```

In this example, `Dog` inherits all the properties and behaviors of `Animal`. In addition, `Dog` has an additional property called `Breed`.

When you create an object of the `Dog` class, it inherits all the properties and behaviors of `Animal`. You can then use these properties and behaviors in your code.

Here are some of the benefits of using inheritance:

* **Reduce code duplication:** You can use inheritance to avoid writing the same code twice.
* **Increase reusability:** You can create new classes by extending existing classes.
* **Ease of maintenance:** Makes your code easier to maintain because it makes it easier to add new features or remove old features.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions." **(Google Bard)**
