1 : "DNS stands for "Domain Name System," and it is a distributed system used on the internet to translate domain names (such as www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1). Essentially, DNS functions as a centralized repository for matching human-readable names to IP addresses that computers and servers can use to find each other on the internet.

When you enter a website address into your web browser, such as "www.example.com," your device sends a request to a DNS server to obtain the IP address associated with that address. Once it obtains the IP address, your device can then connect to the server hosting the desired website.

DNS is crucial for the operation of the internet and makes it much more user-friendly by allowing us to use domain names that are easier to remember instead of complex IP addresses." **(ChatGPT)**
