# Exercises ..

1. A program that asks a person to enter 25 numbers after some and print them in the other every 5 numbers in a line and their sum prints it (using the 2D array).

2. A program that asks a person to enter 25 different numbers and print negative numbers to it.

3. A program that asks the person to enter a group of numbers, and if he finds a number from the one who entered them = 5, it prints it "found".

4. A program that asks a person to enter two numbers that express the size of the 2D array and record the numbers that he will write and print on the other and print their sum.

5. A program that asks the person to enter two numbers that express the size of the 2D array, records the numbers that he will write, prints only the positive numbers from the one who entered them, and prints their number.

6. A program in which an array contains 10 numbers and another array 2D of size 2x5. What is required is that the second array is dictated by the first array.

7. A program in which an array contains 10 numbers and a second array containing 10 different numbers and an array 2D with a space of 2x5 in size.

8. A program that asks a person to enter two numbers that express the size of the 2D array, then enter random numbers in which the array is dictated and the largest number is printed in these numbers.

9. A program that asks a person to enter two numbers that express the size of the 2D array, after that he enters random numbers in which he dictates the array and prints the smallest number in these numbers.

10. A program that asks the user to enter random numbers and the length of the numbers that he enters, and the program is counting as a positive number entered and as a negative number entered and the program stops when the user enters 0.
