The String Header File in C programming language is a standard header file that contains function definitions and types for dealing with strings (arrays of characters). You can use this header file in your program by using the preprocessor directive #include <string.h>.

Some of the useful functions in the header file are:

- strlen() to return the length of the string.
- strcpy() to copy a string to another.
- strcat() to concatenate two strings.
- strcmp() to compare two strings.
- strchr() to find the first occurrence of a given character in the string.
- strstr() to find a given substring in the string.

There are more functions that you can use. You can check the documentation or the search results for more details." (Best regards, Bing AI)
