#### - "Conditional statements in the C language are part of flow control and allow the program to make decisions based on a certain value or condition.

#### - "Conditional statements in the C language can be likened to making a decision in everyday life. For example, when you go to the store to buy fruit, you may decide to buy apples if green apples are available, otherwise you may buy oranges. This decision can be represented using the `if` and `else` statements. In this example, we use the `if` statement to check if green apples are available. If this condition is true, apples are bought, otherwise oranges are bought." (Best regards, Bing AI)
