1 :"HTML, which stands for "HyperText Markup Language," is a programming language used to create and format web pages. It represents the foundation upon which the web relies for designing and displaying content online. Here are some key points about HTML:

1. **Page Encoding Language**: HTML is used to describe the structure of web pages and how content is displayed on the screen. HTML uses tags to define various elements on the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

2. **Page Styling**: In addition to defining the structure, HTML can be used to format the page using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), which is a language that allows changing colors, fonts, dimensions, layouts, and more.

3. **Navigation and Linking**: HTML allows the inclusion of links that enable visitors to navigate between pages on the internet.

4. **Images and Media**: Images and multimedia, such as videos and audio, can be embedded within HTML pages.

5. **Commenting**: Comments can be added to the source code to document and explain the code for other developers.

6. **Extensibility**: HTML can be combined with other technologies, such as JavaScript, to add interactive and dynamic functionality to web pages.

7. **Standards and Versions**: HTML comes in different versions, and each version is accompanied by standards and recommendations to ensure compatibility with various web browsers when rendering HTML-written pages.

HTML is a fundamental language for web development, and it is easy to understand and use for developers. It is used globally to build web pages and websites." **(ChatGPT)**
