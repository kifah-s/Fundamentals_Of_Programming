#### - “Variables are spaces in memory that are reserved for storing different values used in the program. Variables can be defined by specifying their type (such as int for integers, or char for characters) and their name, which is used to refer to them in the program. For example, to define an integer variable named x, the following command can be used: int x;” (ChatGPT)

#### - “Variables can be likened to boxes used to store different things. Just as boxes contain a specific space that can be used to store things, variables contain space in memory that is used to store different values. And just as labels can be placed on boxes to refer to them, a name can be defined for variables to refer to them in the program.” (ChatGPT)
