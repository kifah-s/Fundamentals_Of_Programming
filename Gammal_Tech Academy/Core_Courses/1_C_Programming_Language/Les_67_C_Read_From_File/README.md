- " The "Read from File" feature in the C programming language is used to read data from a text file. This feature allows you to read information that has been previously stored in a file and use it in your program. You can use this feature to read data from regular text files or files containing structured data.

To read from a file, you need to open the file using the fopen() function with the read mode, and then use the available read functions to read data from inside the file. After reading is complete, the file should be closed using the fclose() function.

Here's a simple example that illustrates how to read from a file in the C programming language:

```c

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    FILE *filePointer; // File pointer
    char content[100]; // Array to store read data

    // Open the file for reading
    filePointer = fopen("example.txt", "r");

    if (filePointer == NULL) {
        printf("Failed to open the file.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read data from the file and store it in the array
    fgets(content, sizeof(content), filePointer);

    // Close the file after reading
    fclose(filePointer);

    printf("Data read from the file: %s\n", content);

    return 0;
}

```

In this example, a file named "example.txt" is opened for reading using the "r" (Read) mode. Then, the fgets() function is used to read a line from the file and store it in the content array. Finally, the file is closed using fclose().

It's important to note that using file read features requires handling errors and checking the success of operations." ( ChatGPT )
