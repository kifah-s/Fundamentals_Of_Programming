#### - "The do while loop is a type of loop in the C programming language. This loop repeats at least once and continues to repeat as long as the condition is true." (Best regards, Bing AI)

#### - "The main difference between a do while loop and a while loop is that the condition is evaluated at the end of each iteration in a do while loop, while it is evaluated at the beginning of each iteration in a while loop. This means that a do while loop will repeat at least once, even if the condition is not true from the beginning." (Best regards, Bing AI)

#### - "The do while loop and the for loop are two types of loops in the C programming language. The main difference between them is the way they control repetition. In a do while loop, only the condition is specified and it is evaluated at the end of each iteration. In a for loop, the iteration variable, condition, and expression that controls the change in the value of the iteration variable are specified at the beginning of the loop." (Best regards, Bing AI)
