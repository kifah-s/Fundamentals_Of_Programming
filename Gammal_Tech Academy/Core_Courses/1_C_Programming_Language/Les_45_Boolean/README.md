#### - " The bool data type is a type that represents only two possible values :  true and false. This data type comes in handy when you need to store and test conditional decisions or logical states. In the C programming language, the bool type is not a direct part of the language in older versions (pre-C99). However, you can achieve the same effect using integer values (1 for true and 0 for false). Nonetheless, in C99 and later versions, direct support for the bool data type was added. To create a variable of type bool in C99 and later, you can include the stdbool.h library and use the bool keyword. " ( ChatGPT )

#### - " Here are some examples from reality that are similar to the boolean data type in programming : A light bulb: it is either on or off, A door: it is either open or closed, A cup: it is either full or empty, A person: they are either awake or asleep, A car: it is either running or not running, A house: it is either occupied or unoccupied, A computer: it is either on or off, A phone: it is either connected or not connected, The internet: it is either connected or not connected, As you can see, all of these examples have only two states: either true or false, either present or absent, either on or off. This is exactly what the boolean data type in programming represents. " ( Google Bard )
