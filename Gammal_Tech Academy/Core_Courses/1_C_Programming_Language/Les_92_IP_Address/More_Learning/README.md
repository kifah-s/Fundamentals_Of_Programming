1 : "The ping command is a simple but useful network diagnostic tool that sends ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests to a target IP address or hostname to check if it's reachable and measure the round-trip time for packets to travel to the target and back. Here's a basic example of how to use the ping command:

Open your command prompt or terminal and type the following:

```
ping www.example.com
```

Replace "www.example.com" with the hostname or IP address of the target you want to ping. For example, if you want to ping Google's website, you can use:

```
ping www.google.com
```

When you run the ping command, your computer will start sending ICMP echo requests to the specified host, and you'll see responses indicating whether the host is reachable and the round-trip time for each packet. Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```
Pinging www.google.com [172.217.0.100] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 172.217.0.100: bytes=32 time=12ms TTL=118
Reply from 172.217.0.100: bytes=32 time=13ms TTL=118
Reply from 172.217.0.100: bytes=32 time=11ms TTL=118
Reply from 172.217.0.100: bytes=32 time=12ms TTL=118

Ping statistics for 172.217.0.100:
    Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 11ms, Maximum = 13ms, Average = 12ms
```
In this example, you can see that the host "www.google.com" is reachable, and it provides information about the round-trip time for each packet. The statistics at the end show the number of packets sent, received, and lost, along with the minimum, maximum, and average round-trip times. " **(ChatGPT)**
