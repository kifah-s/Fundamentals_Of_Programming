#### - " Const is a keyword in C programming that is used to define variables that cannot be changed after they are declared. The keyword const can be placed before the variable name or after the type name. For example, the following statement defines a constant variable called PI with a value of 3.14159. Constant variables can be used to improve program performance and make the code more readable. For example, if you have a program that calculates the circumference of a circle, you can use a constant variable to store the value of PI. This will help the program to perform faster because it will not have to calculate the value of PI each time. Additionally, it will make the code more readable because it will clearly indicate that the value of PI is constant. Here are some examples of how constant variables can be used in C programming : You can use constant variables to store values that never change, such as the constant PI or the speed of light constant, You can use constant variables to store values that need to be available to different code modules, such as file names or identifier numbers, You can use constant variables to prevent unintended changes to values, such as settings that are used to configure the program. Overall, constant variables are a useful tool that can be used to improve program performance and make the code more readable. " ( Google Bard )

#### - " The concept of const in programming can be similar to many things in the real world. For example, it can be similar to : A fixed number such as the constant PI, The speed of light, The atomic number of elements, The laws of physics, The rules of mathematics, The rules of language, The rules of law, The rules of traffic, The rules of a game, All of these things are fixed and cannot be changed. The concept of const in programming can be used to represent these things and make the code more readable and consistent. " ( Google Bard )
