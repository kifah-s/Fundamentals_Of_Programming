To declare an array of structures, the structure must first be defined and then an array variable of that type should be defined."

You can store this information in an Array of Structs where each element in the array contains information about one student. In this case, the structure can be defined to contain fields for the name, age, and grade point average. Then an array of this structure can be created and values can be assigned to each element in the array."
