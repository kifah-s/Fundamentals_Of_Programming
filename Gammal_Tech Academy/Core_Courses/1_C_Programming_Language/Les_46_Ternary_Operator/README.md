#### - " The ternary operator is a type of conditional operator in the C programming language, which can be used to make decisions based on a condition in a concise way. This operation takes the following form : (condition) ? expression_if_true : expression_if_false; Where : condition: This is the condition you want to evaluate. If this condition is true (its value is non-zero), expression_if_true is executed. If it's false (its value is zero), expression_if_false is executed. expression_if_true: This is the expression that gets executed if the condition is true. expression_if_false: This is the expression that gets executed if the condition is false. The ternary operator can be used to provide default values or make simple decisions based on specific conditions. However, it should be used with caution as it might make the code less readable if used excessively." ( ChatGPT )

#### - " here is a real-world example similar to the concept of Ternary Operator in programming: Is it sunny? If it is sunny, I will wear a short-sleeved shirt and sandals. If it is not sunny, I will wear a coat and socks. This is an example of the concept of Ternary Operator in real-world. In programming, we can use Ternary Operator to make a decision based on the value of a variable. In this example, we decide what to wear based on the weather. If it is sunny, we will wear a short-sleeved shirt and sandals. If it is not sunny, we will wear a coat and socks. We can use Ternary Operator anywhere we need to make a decision based on the value of a variable. For example, we can use it to determine whether we need to run a certain program or not, or whether we need to send a certain email or not. Ternary Operator is a powerful tool that can be used to simplify code. It can be used to make code more clear and easy to read. " ( Google Bard )
