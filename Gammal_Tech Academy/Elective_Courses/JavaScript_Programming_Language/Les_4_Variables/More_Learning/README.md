**INFO_1 : "Dynamic Programming Language"**

"A dynamic programming language is a category of high-level programming languages that implement many common programming behaviors at runtime that are performed by static programming languages at compile time.

In general, dynamic programming languages are characterized by the following:

- **Dynamic data typing:** In dynamic programming languages, the data type of a variable or constant is not determined at declaration, but rather at assignment. For example, the variable `x` could be of type `int`, `string`, or `object`, depending on the value that is assigned to it.
- **Runtime type checking:** In dynamic programming languages, type checking is performed at runtime. For example, if we assign a value of type `string` to a variable of type `int`, an error will occur at runtime.
- **Anonymous functions:** In dynamic programming languages, anonymous functions can be created without the need to declare them beforehand. For example, we can create an anonymous function using the `function` keyword, as shown below:

```
let foo = function(x) {
  return x * 2;
};
```

- **Extended type:** In dynamic programming languages, an object-type reference can point to an object of any type. For example, we can create a variable of type `object`, then assign it to a reference to an object of type `string`, as shown below:

```
let x = {};
x = "Hello, world!";
```

Dynamic programming languages are used in a variety of domains, including:

- **Web development:** Dynamic programming languages, such as JavaScript, PHP, and Python, are widely used in web development.
- **Scripting:** Dynamic programming languages, such as Python and Ruby, are used in scripting.
- **Machine learning:** Dynamic programming languages, such as Python and R, are used in developing machine learning models.

Here are some examples of dynamic programming languages:

- **JavaScript**
- **PHP**
- **Python**
- **Ruby**
- **Perl**
- **Lua**
- **ECMAScript**

Using dynamic programming languages can be more flexible than using static programming languages, but it can also lead to more complex errors." **(Google Bard)**
