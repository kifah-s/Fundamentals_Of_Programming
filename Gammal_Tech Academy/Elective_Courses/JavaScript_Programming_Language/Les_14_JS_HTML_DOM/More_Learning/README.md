**INFO_1 : "Document Object Model - DOM"**

"DOM stands for "Document Object Model," and it is a programming model used in the JavaScript programming language to represent and interact with the structure of a web document. The DOM serves as a bridge between the HTML or XML document and the JavaScript programming language, allowing developers to dynamically interact with and modify the contents of a web page.

In a simple conceptualization, the DOM can be thought of as a tree of elements, where each element in the document is represented as an object in this tree. The DOM enables developers to identify and manipulate elements, add and remove elements, change content and attributes, interact with events, and perform many other operations.

Key concepts of the DOM include:

1. **Elements:**
   - Represent HTML elements (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<a>`) that can be interacted with.

2. **Attributes:**
   - Properties that define elements, such as `id` and `class`, and can be changed using the DOM.

3. **Text:**
   - The textual content inside elements that can be accessed and modified.

4. **Document:**
   - Represents the entire web page and provides an interface for interaction.

5. **Events:**
   - Enables triggering code when specific events occur, such as clicking or loading.

Through JavaScript interaction with the DOM, dynamic user experiences can be created, and changes can be made to the page without needing to reload it." **(ChatGPT)**
