# Exercises ..

1 : Write a C++ program that declares a std::vector of strings and adds the values "apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", and "elderberry" to it.  
Then, use a for loop to print the values of the vector to the console.

2 : Write a C++ program that declares a function called factorial that takes an integer as input and returns its factorial.  
Use the std::cout function to print the value of the factorial for the input value of 5.

3 : Write a C++ program that declares a class called Rectangle that has two private member variables for the length and width,  
and two public member functions for calculating the area and perimeter of the rectangle.  
Use the std::cout function to print the area and perimeter of a rectangle with length 5 and width 10.

4 : Write a C++ program that uses the std::string class to concatenate two strings and then print the resulting string to the console.

5 : Write a C++ program that declares a std::map of strings and integers, adds the key-value pairs "apple" and 5, "banana" and 10, and "cherry" and 15 to it,  
and then uses the std::cout function to print the value associated with the key "banana" to the console.
