**INFO_1 : "sstream"**

"The `sstream` library is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ and provides tools for manipulating strings and converting between different types. The "S" in "sstream" stands for "string," and this library is often used for working with strings in C++.

The common use of the `sstream` library is in converting basic types such as `int` and `double` to strings and vice versa. This is useful when you need to read input from the user (which is often in string form) and convert it to other types.

Here's a simple example using `stringstream` to convert an `int` to a `string`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    int number = 42;
    
    // Use stringstream to convert int to string
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << number;
    
    std::string result = ss.str();
    
    std::cout << "Number as string: " << result << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

This demonstrates how you can use `stringstream` to convert an `int` to a `string` and use `str()` to get the resulting string.

In summary, `sstream` provides an efficient way to convert between different data types and work with strings in C++." **(ChatGPT)**
