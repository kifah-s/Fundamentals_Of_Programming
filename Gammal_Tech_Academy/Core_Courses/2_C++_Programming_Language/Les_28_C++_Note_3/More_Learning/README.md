**INFO_1 : "object"**

**What is the concept of an object in object-oriented programming?**

In object-oriented programming, an object is the basic unit of data and behavior. An object is defined as a collection of data and functions that interact to represent something in the real world.

For example, an object "car" can be defined as having data such as color, speed, and brand, as well as functions such as driving, braking, and stopping.

Objects can be created by creating instances of a class. A class is defined as a template for creating objects. A class defines the data and functions that objects can have.

For example, a class "car" can be defined as follows:

```
class Car
{
 public:
  // Data
  string color;
  int speed;
  string brand;

  // Functions
  void drive();
  void brake();
  void stop();
};
```

An instance of the class "car" can be created as follows:

```
Car myCar;
```

The data of the object "myCar" can then be accessed and its functions can be used by using the exclamation point ("."). For example:

```
myCar.color = "red";
myCar.drive();
```

The concept of an object provides several advantages, including:

- **Low complexity:** Objects are easy to understand by representing things in the real world.
- **Reusability:** Pre-defined objects can be used to create new applications quickly and easily.
- **Maintainability:** Objects can be reused to create new applications quickly and easily.

Here are some examples of objects in object-oriented programming:

- **Physical objects:** Car, house, person, etc.
- **Non-physical objects:** Bank account, purchase order, etc.
- **Abstract objects:** Idea, concept, etc.

**INFO_2 : "object"**

"In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an "object" is defined as a specific instance of a class. An object is a collection of data and behaviors (variables and functions) that represent an instance of a specific class. The object can exist in the program and perform various activities and functions.

Objects allow for the division and organization of the program into manageable units that reflect the structure and behavior of real-world objects or concepts of interest to the programmer. Each object has properties (data) and methods (functions) used to interact with that object, and they are often associated with the class from which the object is created.

For example, if you want to create a system for managing a library, you can create an object of the "Book" class, which has properties such as title, author, publication year, and methods that allow for various operations, like browsing books and adding a new book.

Object-Oriented Programming focuses on organizing programs around objects, enhancing code reusability, reducing code redundancy, and facilitating maintenance." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO_3 : "Sub Classes - Concept Inheritance"**

**What is the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming?**

In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a feature that allows you to create a new class (subclass) that inherits all the properties and behaviors of another class (superclass). This means that you don't have to recreate everything from scratch when you want to create a new class.

For example, we can create a class "Car" that inherits all the properties and behaviors of a class "Vehicle". This means that cars have the same properties and behaviors as vehicles, such as the ability to drive, brake, and stop.

```
class Vehicle
{
 public:
  // Data
  string color;
  int speed;
  string brand;

  // Functions
  void drive();
  void brake();
  void stop();
};

// Sub Classes - Inheritance
class Car : public Vehicle
{
};
```

In the above example, the class "Car" inherits all the properties and behaviors of the class "Vehicle". We can then create an object from the class "Car" and use it in the same way that we would use an object from the class "Vehicle".

The concept of inheritance provides several advantages, including:

- **Reusability:** We can reuse the properties and behaviors of an existing class to create a new class.
- **Abstraction:** We can unify the properties and behaviors of related objects into a single class.
- **Extension:** We can extend the properties and behaviors of an existing class to create a new class.

Here are some examples of inheritance in object-oriented programming:

- **Animals:** We can create a class "Animal" that is inherited by the classes "Dog", "Cat", and "Horse".
- **Products:** We can create a class "Product" that is inherited by the classes "Book", "Electronic device", and "Furniture".
- **Accounts:** We can create a class "Account" that is inherited by the classes "Savings account", "Checking account", and "Investment account".

Inheritance can be a powerful tool that can be used to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your programs.
