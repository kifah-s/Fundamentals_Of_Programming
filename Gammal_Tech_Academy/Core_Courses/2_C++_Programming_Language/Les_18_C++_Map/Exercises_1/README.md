# Exercises ..

1 : Write a C++ program that creates an empty map and inserts three key-value pairs into it. Then, iterate over the map and print out the keys and values.

2 : Write a C++ program that creates a map with the following key-value pairs: {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three", 4: "four"}. Then, remove the key-value pair with key 2 and print out the updated map.

3 : Write a C++ program that creates a map with the following key-value pairs: {"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "orange": 1}. Then, add a key-value pair for "grape" with value 4 and print out the updated map.

4 : Write a C++ program that creates a map with the following key-value pairs: {1: "one", 2: "two", 3: "three", 4: "four"}. Then, check if the key 3 exists in the map and print out "yes" or "no".

5 : Write a C++ program that creates a map with the following key-value pairs: {"apple": 3, "banana": 2, "orange": 1}. Then, calculate the sum of the values in the map and print out the result.
