**INFO_1 : "range-based for loop"**

"**In the C++ programming language, a range-based for loop is a type of loop that is used to iterate over elements of a collection or range. This type of loop is commonly used to generate output or to process the elements of a collection.**

**The syntax of a range-based for loop is:**

```c++
for (auto element : collection)
{
  // Code to be executed in the loop body.
}
```

**Where:**

- `collection` is a collection or range that you want to iterate over.
- `element` is a variable that is used to represent each element in the collection or range.

**Here is an example of how to use a range-based for loop to generate output:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  // Create an array of integers.
  int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

  // Iterate over the array and print each element.
  for (int number : numbers)
  {
    std::cout << number << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

**This code will print the following output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

**Here is another example of how to use a range-based for loop to process the elements of a collection:**

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()

{
  // Create a vector of strings.
  std::vector<std::string> names = {"John", "Jane", "Peter", "Mary"};

  // Iterate over the vector and capitalize each string.
  for (std::string name : names)
  {
    name[0] = toupper(name[0]);
  }

  // Print the capitalized strings.
  for (std::string name : names)
  {
    std::cout << name << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

**This code will print the following output:**

```
JOHN
JANE
PETER
MARY
```

**A range-based for loop is a more efficient and easier-to-read alternative to the traditional types of loops in C++.**" **(Google Bard)**

**INFO_2 : "Range-based for loop"**

"In C++, the "Range-based for loop" is an advanced type of loop that makes it easy for programmers to iterate through a collection of data, such as an array or a container, in a more readable and straightforward way.

The general syntax of the "Range-based for loop" is as follows:

```cpp
for (data_type variable : range) {
    // Perform operations here using the variable
}
```

Where:
- `data_type` is the data type of the collection's elements.
- `variable` is the variable that will be used to access the elements of the collection.
- `range` is the collection from which you want to utilize the elements.

Here's an example of using the "Range-based for loop" with an array:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    for (int number : numbers)
    {
        cout << number << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The above loop will iterate over each element in the `numbers` array and print the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 sequentially. This makes the code more readable and less complex when working with data collections." **(ChatGPT)**
