1 : Write a program that reads in an array of integers and calculates the average of all the elements in the array.

2 : You are given an array of doubles of items in a store that have different prices (see template). Write a program that takes the "percent off" discount as input and outputs discounted item prices on one line in the same sequence you are given, separated by a space (" ").  
Note: To get a discounted price use the formula: a â€“ a\*p/100, where a is the initial price and p is the discount percent off.
