**INFO_1 : "The skill of tracing"**

"The skill of tracing in programming refers to the ability to understand how a program executes step by step, meaning tracing the flow of execution of the program. This skill is important for software engineers for several reasons:

1. **Error Analysis (Debugging):** When an error occurs in the program, whether it's a compile-time or runtime error, tracing skill helps identify the location of the error and understand the context that led to its occurrence.

2. **Performance Optimization:** When facing low performance in the program, tracing can be used to identify areas that can be optimized, improving the efficiency of execution.

3. **Understanding Program Flow:** Tracing the execution flow helps understand how the program interacts with various data and variables during runtime, contributing to improving the design and understanding the expected impact of changes.

4. **Program Validation:** When updating the program or making changes, tracing can be used to verify the correctness of the changes and their impact on the rest of the program.

5. **Learning Language and Tools:** Through tracing, you can learn how to use the programming language and supporting tools better, as it provides a deep understanding of how the program interacts with the environment.

In general, tracing skill is an important part of the skill set that software engineers should master to develop and maintain software applications effectively." **(ChatGPT)**
