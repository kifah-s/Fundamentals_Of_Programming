**INFO_1 : "`fstream` class"**

In the C++ programming language, files are handled using the `fstream` class. This class provides tools for opening, reading, and writing files.

**Opening a file**

To open a file, you can use the `open()` method. This method takes three parameters:

- The file name
- The file mode
- The access mode

The file mode is one of the following values:

- `ios::in`: For reading only
- `ios::out`: For writing only
- `ios::in | ios::out`: For reading and writing

The access mode is one of the following values:

- `ios::binary`: For handling binary files
- `ios::text`: For handling text files

Here is an example of how to open a file for reading only:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main()
{
  // Open a file for reading only
  std::fstream file("myfile.txt", std::ios::in);

  // Check if the file is open
  if (file.is_open())
  {
    // Read data from the file
    std::string line;
    while (getline(file, line))
    {
      std::cout << line << std::endl;
    }

    // Close the file
    file.close();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code will open the file `myfile.txt` for reading only. If the file exists, it will be opened and each line from the file will be read. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

**Closing a file**

To close a file, you can use the `close()` method. This method takes one parameter:

- The handle to the file

Here is an example of how to close a file:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main()
{
  // Open a file for reading only
  std::fstream file("myfile.txt", std::ios::in);

  // Check if the file is open
  if (file.is_open())
  {
    // Read data from the file
    std::string line;
    while (getline(file, line))
    {
      std::cout << line << std::endl;
    }

    // Close the file
    file.close();
  }

  return 0;
}
```

This code will close the file `myfile.txt` once you are finished reading from it.

**Other examples**

Here are some other examples of ways to handle files in C++:

- Writing data to a file:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main()
{
  // Open a file for writing only
  std::fstream file("myfile.txt", std::ios::out);

  // Write data to the file
  file << "This is a test." << std::endl;

  // Close the file
  file.close();

  return 0;
}
```

- Reading data from a binary file:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main()
{
  // Open a file for reading only
  std::fstream file("myfile.bin", std::ios::in | std::ios::binary);

  // Read data from the file
  int number;
  file.read((char*)&number, sizeof(int));

  // Print the data
  std::cout << number << std::endl;

  // Close the file
  file.close();

  return 0;
}
```

- Checking if a file exists:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main()
{
  // Check if a file exists
  std::fstream file("myfile.txt");
  if (file.is_open())
  {
    std::cout << "The file exists." << std::endl;
  }
  else
  {
    std::cout << "The file does not exist." << std::endl;
  }

  return 0;
}
```

**INFO_2 : "`getline()` command"**

In the C++ programming language, the `getline()` command is a command used to read an entire line of data from a file or from the user through the standard input (stdin).

The `getline()` command takes two parameters:

- A handle to the file or stdin
- A pointer to a string where the data that was read will be stored

The `getline()` command will read data from the file or from stdin until it reaches the newline character (`\n`). The data that was read will be stored in the specified string.

Here is an example of how to use the `getline()` command to read a line from a file:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main()
{
  // Open a file for reading only
  std::fstream file("myfile.txt", std::ios::in);

  // Read a line from the file
  std::string line;
  getline(file, line);

  // Print the line that was read
  std::cout << line << std::endl;

  // Close the file
  file.close();

  return 0;
}
```

This code will open the file `myfile.txt` for reading only. If the file exists, it will be opened and the first line of the file will be read. The line that was read will be stored in the string `line`. The line that was read will be printed to the standard output.

Here is an example of how to use the `getline()` command to read a line from the user:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  // Read a line from the user
  std::string line;
  getline(std::cin, line);

  // Print the line that was read
  std::cout << line << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This code will read a line from the user from stdin. The line that was read will be stored in the string `line`. The line that was read will be printed to the standard output.

In simple terms, we can say that the `getline()` command is a command that allows us to read an entire line of data from a source." **(Google Bard)**

**INFO_2 : "`ignore()` function"**

In the C++ programming language, the `ignore()` function is a function used to ignore a certain number of characters from the standard input (stdin).

The `ignore()` function takes two parameters:

- The number of characters to be ignored
- The delimiter character, which is the character that will be used to stop ignoring characters.

If no delimiter character is specified, the newline character (`\n`) will be used as the delimiter character.

Here is an example of how to use the `ignore()` function to ignore whitespace from stdin:

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  // Ignore whitespace
  std::cin.ignore(std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max(), ' ');

  // Read a line from the user
  std::string line;
  std::cin >> line;

  // Print the line that was read
  std::cout << line << std::endl;

  return 0;
}
```

This code will ignore all whitespace from stdin. A line will then be read from the user. The line that was read will be printed to the standard output.

In simple terms, we can say that the `ignore()` function is a function that allows us to ignore a certain number of characters from stdin.

Here are some common uses of the `ignore()` function:

- To ignore whitespace from stdin before reading a line from the user.
- To ignore the rest of the user's line after reading a certain value.
- To ignore the error code from stdin.

**Warning:** The `ignore()` function should be used with caution, as it can lead to data loss.
