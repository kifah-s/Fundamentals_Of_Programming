1 : Create a header file called "temperature.h" that defines a function called "convert_to_celsius" which takes a temperature value in Fahrenheit as an argument and returns the corresponding value in Celsius.  
Implement the function in a separate file called "temperature.cpp". Use a main function in a separate file called "main.cpp" to call the "convert_to_celsius" function and print the result.
