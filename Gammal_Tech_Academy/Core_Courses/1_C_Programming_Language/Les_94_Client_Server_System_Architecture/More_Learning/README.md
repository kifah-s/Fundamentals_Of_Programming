1 : "The Client-Server System Architecture is a common design pattern in the field of information technology and networks. This pattern is used to build applications and systems that enable interaction and communication between two main components: the client and the server.

**Client**: It is a device or application used by the end-user to access specific services or resources on the network. The client connects to the server to request specific information or services. Clients can be personal computers, smartphones, or even web applications.

**Server**: It is the part that provides services or information to clients. The server receives client requests, processes them, and responds based on the requirements. Servers have resources and data that clients need and provide them.

When the client makes a request (such as requesting a web page or data from a database), it connects to the server over the network. The server responds by processing the request and sending the requested data or service to the client. This interaction allows the distribution of services efficiently over the network.

The advantages of the Client-Server System Architecture include separating clients and servers, making their management and maintenance easier, enhancing security and protection, improving performance by effectively distributing workloads among servers, and achieving better scalability and flexibility for information systems." **(ChatGPT)**
