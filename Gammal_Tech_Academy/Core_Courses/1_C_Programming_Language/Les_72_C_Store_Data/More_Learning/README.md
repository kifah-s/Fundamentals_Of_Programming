1 : "The "Append" function in file handling in the C programming language is used to open an existing file and add new content to the end of it instead of replacing the old content entirely. In other words, when you use the append mode, the file is opened for writing at its end without deleting the current content.

To do this, you can use the "a" mode as part of the fopen() function or direct it to an existing file. For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    FILE *filePtr;

    // Open the file for writing in append mode ("a")
    filePtr = fopen("myFile.txt", "a");

    if (filePtr == NULL) {
        printf("Could not open the file.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Write to the file
    fprintf(filePtr, "This line will be appended.\n");

    // Close the file
    fclose(filePtr);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the file "myFile.txt" is opened in append mode "a" using fopen(), then content is written to the file using fprintf(), and finally, the file is closed using fclose().

With the append mode, you can add new content to the file without affecting the current content. This is useful when you want to append records to a log file or periodically update a file without losing the previous content." ( ChatGPT )

2 : "When you add a "+" sign to the file open mode in the C programming language, it has a specific effect depending on the chosen mode. This mode is used to open the file for both reading and writing, and if the file is not found, it is created.

The "a+" mode means accessing the file in addition to reading and writing. Here's an explanation of its effect:

- Reading (Read): You can use the file for reading, which means you can read the current content of the file.

- Writing (Write): You can also use the file for writing. If you write to the file, the new content will be added to the end of the file without deleting the old content. This is useful when you want to add new data without changing the existing content.

- Creating a New File (Create): If the specified file is not found, it will be created.

The common use of "a+" mode is to append new information to an existing file without losing the previous content. For example, if you want to log events in a log file and add new records with each run of the program without erasing the old records, you can use "a+" mode for this purpose." (Chat GPT)
