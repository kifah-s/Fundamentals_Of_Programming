1 : "Threads are a concept in the C programming language used to enable multitasking within a single program. This means you can run multiple parts of the program concurrently, where each of these parts has its independent execution plan.

Threads can be used for synchronous or parallel activities, such as interacting with the user in the user interface or processing data in the background without affecting the execution of the main program.

Threads can be valuable in cases where programs require quick responsiveness to events or dealing with parallel operations like data processing or synchronous communication with external devices.

In short, threads allow you to achieve balance and organization in program execution and make better use of multiple processors if they are available in your system." **( ChatGPT )**
