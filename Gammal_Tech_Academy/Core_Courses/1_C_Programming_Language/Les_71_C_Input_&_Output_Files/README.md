- " Reading from files and writing to files are very important functions in the C programming language, and they have several significances:

  1. Data Storage: Allows you to store data permanently on the hard drive. This means you can retain information between program runs and access it later.

  2. Handling Large Files: Reading and writing files are widely used to process large files such as text files, databases, and configuration files. This allows programs to work with large amounts of data without the need to store it all in memory.

  3. Configuration and Settings: Reading from files can be used to configure applications. For example, you can store settings, keys, or templates in text files and read them to adjust the behavior of the application.

  4. External Data Processing: File reading can be used to import data from external sources such as CSV or JSON files. This data can then be processed within the program.

  5. Text Analysis: File reading can be used to analyze texts, such as parsing code files or searching text files for specific content.

  6. Data Filtering: File writing can be used to store data or report results. For example, a program can generate reports or log files to record events.

  7. Security and Durability: File writing is used to save data securely and durably. This can be particularly important in applications dealing with sensitive data or needing to keep records for an extended period.

In conclusion, reading from files and writing to files are considered fundamental in most programming applications as they assist in efficiently storing, processing, and retrieving data in a permanent manner." ( Chat GPT )
