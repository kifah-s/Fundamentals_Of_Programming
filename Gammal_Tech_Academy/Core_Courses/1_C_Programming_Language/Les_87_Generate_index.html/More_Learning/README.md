1 : "The "index.html" file is a fundamental HTML file that is typically used as a starting point for a website. When a directory or folder on a web server is visited through a web browser, the browser automatically looks for an "index.html" file in that directory and displays its content as the main web page for the site.

In other words, "index.html" serves as the main page that is loaded first when visiting a website. This file usually contains the essential elements for the homepage, such as the logo, menu, and main content. Of course, "index.html" can also contain links that direct users to other pages within the site.
