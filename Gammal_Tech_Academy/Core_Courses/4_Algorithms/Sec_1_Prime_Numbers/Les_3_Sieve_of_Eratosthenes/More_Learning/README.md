**INFO 1: "Sieve of Eratosthenes"**

"The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is a method used to efficiently find all prime numbers smaller than a given number. This algorithm was invented by the ancient mathematician Eratosthenes in the 3rd century BCE.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm relies on a simple principle:

1. Create a list of length n+1 (where n is the maximum number we want to search for prime numbers within).
2. Initially, all numbers in the list are considered prime.
3. The algorithm starts by examining numbers starting from 2 (the smallest prime number) and removes all multiples of this number from the list (except the number itself).
4. The algorithm continues these steps until reaching the number n.

By this method, in the end, the list will contain only the numbers that haven't been removed, all of which are considered prime.

The Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is highly efficient and operates quickly when searching for small prime numbers. It's worth mentioning that it is widely used in programming for purposes such as cryptography, applied mathematics, and numerical computing." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Sieve of Eratosthenes"**

"**Definition:**

The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a simple algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a specified integer.

**How it works:**

1. **Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to the given integer.**
2. **Starting from 2, mark all multiples of 2 greater than 2 as composite (non-prime).**
3. **Find the next unmarked number in the list greater than 2. This is the next prime number.**
4. **Mark all multiples of this prime number greater than itself as composite.**
5. **Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the square of the current prime number is greater than the given integer.**
6. **All the remaining unmarked numbers in the list are prime numbers.**

**Example:**

**Finding all prime numbers up to 120:**

1. **Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 to 120.**
2. **Starting from 2, mark all multiples of 2 greater than 2 as composite (4, 6, 8, ...).**
3. **The next unmarked number greater than 2 is 3.**
4. **Mark all multiples of 3 greater than 3 as composite (6, 9, 12, ...).**
5. **The next unmarked number greater than 3 is 5.**
6. **Mark all multiples of 5 greater than 5 as composite (10, 15, 20, ...).**
7. **Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the square of the current prime number is greater than 120.**
8. **All the remaining unmarked numbers in the list are prime numbers.**

**Advantages of the Sieve of Eratosthenes:**

* **Simple and easy to understand.**
* **Efficient for finding small prime numbers.**

**Disadvantages of the Sieve of Eratosthenes:**

* **Not efficient for finding large prime numbers.**
* **Requires a large amount of memory to store all the numbers up to the given integer.**" **(Gemini)**
