**INFO 1: "Waterfall"**

"The Waterfall Model is a software development methodology that follows a sequential, linear progression of steps. This methodology represents a sequential approach where each phase is completed before moving on to the next one. The key steps in the Waterfall Model include:

1. **Requirements Definition:**
   - Identify and document the software requirements presumed to meet the project goals.

2. **Design:**
   - Create a detailed design of the system based on the specified requirements, including determining the overall structure and component distribution.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Write the code or actually implement the system, transforming the design into executable code.

4. **Testing:**
   - Test the software to ensure it meets the requirements and functions correctly. This includes unit testing and system testing.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Move the software to the production environment and install it for actual use.

6. **Maintenance:**
   - Maintain and update the software over time to meet new needs or correct any errors that may arise.

### Advantages of the Waterfall Model:

- **Clear Structure:** Provides a clear structure for software development with a sequential progression of stages.

- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Requires complete documentation of requirements and design before implementation, promoting clarity and consistency.

- **Ease of Control:** Easy control over changes before starting the next phase.

### Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model:

- **Difficulty in Modifications:** It may be challenging to introduce significant modifications after starting a certain phase.

- **Response to Changes:** Adapting to changes in requirements after implementation has begun can be difficult.

- **Not Suitable for Large and Complex Projects:** Not suitable for large and complex projects where significant changes may be required during development stages.

Despite its drawbacks, the Waterfall Model may be suitable for small projects or projects with stable and well-defined requirements from the beginning." **(ChatGPT)**
