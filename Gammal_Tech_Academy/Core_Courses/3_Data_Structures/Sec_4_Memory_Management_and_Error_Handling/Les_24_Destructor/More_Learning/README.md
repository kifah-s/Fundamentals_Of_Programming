**INFO 1: "Destructor"**

"In the C++ programming language, a Destructor is a special type of function that is called when an object of a class is being destroyed. The Destructor is used to perform any cleanup or preparation operations before the object is removed from memory.

The Destructor bears the same name as the class and is defined by adding a tilde (~) before the class name. For example, if we have a class called `MyClass`, its Destructor would be defined as follows:

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Constructor
    MyClass() {
        // Construction operations
    }

    // Destructor
    ~MyClass() {
        // Destruction operations (cleanup)
    }
};
```

The Destructor is automatically called when the object's scope ends or when the `delete` function is called to delete the object if it was created using `new`. It allows the programmer to specify custom cleanup or preparation operations before deleting the object, improving resource management and helping to avoid memory leaks.

For example, the Destructor can be used to close a file or release dynamic memory before deleting the object." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Destructor"**

"A destructor is a special member function that is automatically called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted with `delete` or `delete[]`. Destructors are used to perform cleanup tasks, such as releasing memory or closing files, that are associated with the object.

**Properties of destructors:**

* **Destructor name:** The name of the destructor is the same as the class name prefixed with the tilde (~) symbol. For example, if we have a class called `MyClass`, its destructor will be `~MyClass()`.
* **Destructor parameters:** Destructors cannot have any parameters.
* **Destructor return value:** Destructors cannot return any value.
* **Destructor invocation:** Destructors are automatically called in the following cases:
    * When the object goes out of scope (function or block scope).
    * When the `delete` operator is used to explicitly delete the object.
    * When an unhandled exception occurs within the object.

**Destructor uses:**

* **Memory deallocation:** Destructors are primarily used to deallocate memory that was allocated dynamically for the object using `new` or `malloc`.
* **Closing files:** Destructors can be used to close files that were opened by the object.
* **Releasing other resources:** Destructors can be used to release any other resources that were allocated by the object, such as handles to devices or network connections.

**Destructor example:**

```c++
class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        // Allocate memory
        data = new int[100];
    }

    ~MyClass() {
        // Deallocate memory
        delete[] data;
    }

private:
    int* data;
};

int main() {
    MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
    // ...
    delete obj;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the destructor deallocates the memory that was allocated by the object using `new`.

**Summary:**

Destructors are an important tool in C++ for effectively managing memory and other resources. By using destructors, you can ensure that all resources allocated by an object are released before it is destroyed." **(Gemini)**
