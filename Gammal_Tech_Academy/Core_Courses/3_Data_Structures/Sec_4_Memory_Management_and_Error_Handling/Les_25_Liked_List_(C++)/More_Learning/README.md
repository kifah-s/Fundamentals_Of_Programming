**INFO 1: "Linked Lists in C++"**

"**What are linked lists?**

A linked list is a dynamic data structure that consists of a collection of nodes linked together by pointers. Each node stores specific data, such as a number or a name, and a pointer that points to the next node in the list.

**Advantages of linked lists:**

* **Flexibility:** Easy to add or delete nodes anywhere in the list.
* **Memory efficiency:** Memory is allocated to nodes only when needed, making them suitable for storing large amounts of data.
* **Ease of implementation:** Writing code for linked lists is relatively simple.

**Disadvantages of linked lists:**

* **Slow random access:** Accessing a specific element in the list requires traversing all the previous nodes.
* **Complexity of management:** Memory management in linked lists requires more attention to avoid memory leaks.

**Types of linked lists:**

* **Singly linked list:** Each node consists of data and one pointer that points to the next node.
* **Doubly linked list:** Each node consists of data and two pointers, one pointing to the next node and the other pointing to the previous node.

**How linked lists work:**

1. **Creating the first node:** The first node in the list is created and memory is allocated for it.
2. **Adding a new node:** A new node is created and memory is allocated for it, then it is linked to the previous node.
3. **Deleting a node:** The node to be deleted is identified, then the previous node is linked to the next node.
4. **Accessing a specific element:** All nodes in the list are traversed until the desired element is found.

**Examples of using linked lists:**

* Storing a list of names.
* Storing a list of numbers.
* Implementing algorithms such as a stack or a queue."

**INFO 2: "Linked Lists in C++"**

"A Linked List is a data structure used to store and organize data in a non-sequential manner in memory. The Linked List consists of nodes, each containing data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

Here is a simple example of how to define and use a Linked List in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

// Node definition
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;

    // Node constructor
    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};

// Linked List definition
class LinkedList {
public:
    Node* head;

    // LinkedList constructor
    LinkedList() : head(nullptr) {}

    // Add a new node to the end of the list
    void append(int value) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(value);
        if (head == nullptr) {
            head = newNode;
        } else {
            Node* current = head;
            while (current->next != nullptr) {
                current = current->next;
            }
            current->next = newNode;
        }
    }

    // Print the list
    void printList() {
        Node* current = head;
        while (current != nullptr) {
            std::cout << current->data << " ";
            current = current->next;
        }
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create a new list
    LinkedList myList;

    // Add nodes to the list
    myList.append(1);
    myList.append(2);
    myList.append(3);

    // Print the list
    std::cout << "Linked List: ";
    myList.printList();

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Node` is defined as a node containing data and a link to the next node. Then, a `LinkedList` is defined to manage the nodes, providing functions such as `append` to add a new node to the end of the list and `printList` to print the list.

This is a simple example that can be modified and expanded with more functions as needed."
