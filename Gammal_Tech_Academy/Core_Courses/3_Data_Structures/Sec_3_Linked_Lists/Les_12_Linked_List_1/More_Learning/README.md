**INFO 1: "linked list"**

"**A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of nodes. Each node contains two fields: data and a link to the next node in the sequence.**

**Linked lists are a dynamic data structure, which means that they can grow and shrink as needed. This is in contrast to arrays, which are static data structures and cannot be resized after they are created.**

**Linked lists are used to store a collection of data elements in a way that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements. This is because linked lists do not have to be contiguous in memory, which means that elements can be added and removed without shifting the other elements in the list.**

**Linked lists are also relatively easy to implement, which makes them a popular data structure for a variety of applications.**

**Here are some of the advantages of using linked lists:**

* Efficient insertion and deletion of elements
* Dynamic data structure
* Relatively easy to implement

**Here are some of the disadvantages of using linked lists:**

* Slower access to elements than arrays
* More memory overhead than arrays
* Can be more complex to manage than arrays

**Linked lists are a versatile data structure that can be used for a variety of applications. They are particularly well-suited for applications that require efficient insertion and deletion of elements, such as databases and search engines.**" **(Google Bard)**
