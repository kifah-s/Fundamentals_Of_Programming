### üîó What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a type of **data structure** used to store a collection of elements (like numbers or objects), but in a different way than an **Array**.

### üëà The main difference between Array and Linked List:

| Feature            | Array                     | Linked List                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Memory storage     | Contiguous (side by side) | Non-contiguous (scattered) |
| Insertion/Deletion | Relatively hard           | Very easy                  |
| Access to elements | Fast (random access)      | Slow (sequential access)   |

### üß± Components of a Linked List:

Each element in the Linked List is called a **Node**, and every node contains:

1. **Data**: the value we want to store.
2. **Pointer**: a link to the next node in the list.

Example of two linked nodes:

```
[10 | ‚û°Ô∏è ] ‚Üí [20 | ‚û°Ô∏è ] ‚Üí null
```

### üß© Types of Linked List:

1. **Singly Linked List**: Each node has a pointer to the next node only.
2. **Doubly Linked List**: Each node has two pointers: one to the next and one to the previous node.
3. **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node instead of `null`.

### üîÅ Simple Example (Singly Linked List in C++):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

int main() {
    // Create three nodes
    Node* first = new Node();
    Node* second = new Node();
    Node* third = new Node();

    // Assign data and link nodes
    first->data = 1;
    first->next = second;

    second->data = 2;
    second->next = third;

    third->data = 3;
    third->next = nullptr;

    // Print the list
    Node* current = first;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        cout << current->data << " ";
        current = current->next;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

üîπ Output: `1 2 3`

The concept of a **Linked List** in programming is a dynamic data structure used to store and organize data in a sequential manner. A linked list consists of a series of nodes, where each node contains two main parts:

1. **Data:** The value or information we want to store.
2. **Pointer:** An address that points to the next node in the sequence (or the previous node in the case of a doubly linked list).

### How does a Linked List work?

Unlike arrays, which store elements in contiguous memory locations, a linked list does not require elements to be adjacent. Instead, nodes are connected to each other through pointers. This means each node knows the location of the next node, allowing great flexibility in adding or removing elements.

### Types of Linked Lists:

1. **Singly Linked List:**

   - Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node only.
   - It starts from the first node (Head) and ends at the last node, whose pointer is null.

2. **Doubly Linked List:**

   - Each node contains data and two pointers: one pointing to the next node and another to the previous node.
   - It allows traversal in both directions.

3. **Circular Linked List:**
   - The last node points back to the first node, making the list circular.

### Advantages of a Linked List:

- **Size Flexibility:** Elements can be easily added or removed without needing to pre-allocate space.
- **Efficiency in Insertion and Deletion:** Especially at the beginning or middle of the list, compared to arrays.

### Disadvantages of a Linked List:

- **Inefficient Random Access:** You cannot directly access a specific element (like in arrays using an index); you must traverse the list from the start.
- **Extra Memory Usage:** Due to storing pointers with each node.

### Simple Example:

Suppose we have a singly linked list containing the numbers: 10 ‚Üí 20 ‚Üí 30

- First node: (Data: 10, Pointer: points to the node with 20)
- Second node: (Data: 20, Pointer: points to the node with 30)
- Third node: (Data: 30, Pointer: Null)

### When to use it?

Linked lists are used in cases requiring frequent insertion and deletion of elements or when the size of the data is unknown in advance, such as in playlist applications or memory management in operating systems.

In programming, especially in the C++ programming language, a **Linked List** is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of elements called **Nodes**. Unlike arrays, where elements are stored in contiguous memory locations, the elements in a linked list are not necessarily stored adjacently. Instead, each node contains two main parts:

1.  **Data:** The part that stores the actual value of the element. This can be any type of data (integer, float, string, object, etc.).
2.  **Pointer/Link:** The part that holds the memory address of the next node in the sequence. This pointer is what "links" the nodes together to form the list.

**Visualizing a Linked List:**

Imagine a chain of boxes, where each box contains a piece of information (the data) and an arrow pointing to the next box in the chain (the pointer). The last box in the chain doesn't point to anything, and its pointer is usually a special value indicating the end of the list (like `nullptr` in C++).

**Basic Elements of a Linked List:**

- **Head:** A pointer that points to the first node in the list. If the list is empty, the head is `nullptr`.
- **Node:** The fundamental unit in a linked list, containing the data and the pointer to the next node.
- **Tail:** A pointer that points to the last node in the list. The tail's `next` pointer is always `nullptr`.

**Types of Linked Lists:**

There are several types of linked lists, the most important of which are:

- **Singly Linked List:** Each node contains only one pointer, which points to the next node. This is the most common and simplest type.
- **Doubly Linked List:** Each node contains two pointers: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node. This allows traversal of the list in both directions.
- **Circular Linked List:** The `next` pointer of the last node points back to the first node, forming a loop. Circular linked lists can be singly or doubly linked.

**Advantages of Linked Lists:**

- **Efficient Insertion and Deletion:** Adding or removing an element at any position in the list is highly efficient (once the desired location is found) because it only involves changing pointers, without the need to shift other elements as in arrays.
- **Dynamic Size:** Linked lists can grow or shrink dynamically during program execution as needed, as memory is allocated for nodes only when they are added. This differs from arrays, which usually have a fixed size when created.
- **No Contiguous Memory Required:** The nodes of a linked list can be stored anywhere in memory, as they are linked by pointers.

**Disadvantages of Linked Lists:**

- **Inefficient Random Access:** To access a specific element in a linked list (e.g., the element at index `n`), you need to start from the head and follow the pointers until you reach the desired element. This makes random access (accessing any element directly using its index) an inefficient operation with a linear time complexity (O(n)). In contrast, random access in arrays is a constant time operation (O(1)).
- **Extra Memory Overhead:** Each node in a linked list requires extra space to store the pointer (or two pointers in a doubly linked list), which increases memory consumption compared to arrays that store only the data contiguously.
- **Implementation Complexity:** Implementing certain operations on linked lists can be more complex than implementing similar operations on arrays, especially when dealing with pointers and updating them correctly to avoid losing links or causing memory errors.

**Uses of Linked Lists:**

Linked lists are used in various data structures and applications, including:

- **Implementing other data structures:** Such as Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables.
- **Dynamic memory management:** They can be used to keep track of free and used memory blocks.
- **Representing lists and tables that require frequent insertions and deletions:** Such as playlists and task lists.
- **Implementing graphs:** They can be used to represent adjacency lists.
- **Various algorithms:** Such as sorting and searching algorithms.

**Simple Example in C++ (Singly Linked List):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};

int main() {
    // Creating nodes
    Node* head = new Node(1);
    Node* second = new Node(2);
    Node* third = new Node(3);

    // Linking the nodes
    head->next = second;
    second->next = third;

    // Printing the elements of the list
    Node* current = head;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        std::cout << current->data << " -> ";
        current = current->next;
    }
    std::cout << "nullptr" << std::endl;

    // Don't forget to free the memory to avoid memory leaks
    delete head;
    delete second;
    delete third;

    return 0;
}
```

In this simple example, we created three nodes containing the data 1, 2, and 3, and then linked them together to form a linked list. Finally, we traversed the list and printed the data value of each node.
