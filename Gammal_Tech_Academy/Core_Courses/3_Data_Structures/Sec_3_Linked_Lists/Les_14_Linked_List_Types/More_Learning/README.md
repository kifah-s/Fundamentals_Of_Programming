**INFO 1: "Types of Linked Lists"**

"There are several types of Linked Lists, each with its own uses and specific features. Here are some main types:

1. **Singly Linked List:**
   - Each node contains data and a link to the next node in the list.
   - Easy to traverse and manipulate forwards (from the beginning to the end).
   - Consumes less memory compared to some other types.

2. **Doubly Linked List:**
   - Each node contains data and two links, one pointing to the previous node and the other to the next node.
   - Allows traversal in both directions (forward and backward).
   - Consumes more memory compared to a Singly Linked List.

3. **Circular Linked List:**
   - Resembles a Singly Linked List, but the link in the last node points to the first node, forming a circular structure.
   - Can be used in problems requiring a continuous cycle.

4. **Circular Doubly Linked List:**
   - Similar to a Doubly Linked List, but the link in the last node points to the first node, and the link in the first node points to the last node.

5. **Skip List:**
   - Uses a multi-level structure to provide a way to speed up searches.
   - Includes layers stacked on top of each other, where some nodes are skipped in the higher layers.

6. **Self-adjusting Lists:**
   - Automatically adjusts the order of nodes with each search or insertion operation.

These are some main types of Linked Lists, and there can be other types derived from these main types to meet specific programming needs." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Types of Linked Lists"**

"**There are three main types of linked lists:**

**1. Singly linked list:**

* It is the simplest type of linked list.
* It consists of nodes connected to each other using pointers.
* Each node contains the data and the link to the next node.

**2. Doubly linked list:**

* It consists of nodes connected to each other using two pointers.
* Each node contains the data, the link to the next node, and the link to the previous node.
* Doubly linked lists allow access to elements in both directions.

**3. Circular linked list:**

* It consists of nodes connected to each other using pointers.
* The last node in the list points to the first node.
* This means that the list forms a loop.

**Here are some advantages and disadvantages of each type of linked list:**

**Singly linked list:**

**Advantages:**

* Easy to implement
* Space efficient

**Disadvantages:**

* Cannot access elements in the reverse direction
* Can be slow in some cases

**Doubly linked list:**

**Advantages:**

* Can access elements in both directions
* More efficient in some cases

**Disadvantages:**

* More complex to implement
* Requires more space

**Circular linked list:**

**Advantages:**

* Does not require a sentinel node
* Can access any element in the list from any other element

**Disadvantages:**

* More complex to implement
* Can be slow in some cases

**Choosing the type of linked list:**

The choice of the type of linked list depends on the needs of the application. If the application only needs to access elements in one direction, then a singly linked list is the best option. If the application needs to access elements in both directions, then a doubly linked list is the best option. If the application needs to access any element in the list from any other element, then a circular linked list is the best option.

**Here are some examples of how each type of linked list can be used:**

**Singly linked list:**

* Storing a list of names and numbers
* Storing a list of tasks

**Doubly linked list:**

* Storing a list of links on a website
* Storing a list of items in a video game

**Circular linked list:**

* Storing a list of numbers in a dice game
* Storing a list of players in a game

**In general, linked lists are a good choice for storage applications that require flexibility and efficiency in inserting and deleting elements.**" **(Google Bard)**
