### üîÅ What is a Circular Linked List?

A **Circular Linked List** is a type of **Linked List**, but with a small difference:

In a regular **Singly Linked List**, the last node points to `nullptr`.

However, in a **Circular Linked List**, **the last node doesn‚Äôt point to nullptr, but instead points back to the first node**, making the list circular (i.e., you can loop through it infinitely).

### üì¶ Basic Node Structure

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};
```

### üìå Key Characteristics:

- There‚Äôs no clear end, because if you keep traversing, you‚Äôll eventually return to the start.
- It's useful in scenarios where continuous looping is needed (like in games or circular queues).

### üåÄ Simple Example:

Assume we have the elements: `10 -> 20 -> 30`

In a **Singly Linked List**:

```
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> nullptr
```

In a **Circular Linked List**:

```
10 -> 20 -> 30 --+
 ^               |
 |_______________|
```

### ‚úÖ Simple Code to Create a Circular Linked List:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

void printList(Node* head) {
    if (head == nullptr) return;

    Node* temp = head;
    do {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    } while (temp != head);
    cout << endl;
}

void insertEnd(Node*& head, int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node{value, nullptr};
    if (head == nullptr) {
        newNode->next = newNode;
        head = newNode;
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp->next != head)
        temp = temp->next;

    temp->next = newNode;
    newNode->next = head;
}

int main() {
    Node* head = nullptr;

    insertEnd(head, 10);
    insertEnd(head, 20);
    insertEnd(head, 30);

    printList(head);  // Output: 10 20 30

    return 0;
}
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes:

- Be careful while traversing a circular linked list to avoid **infinite loops**.
- You can also have a **Circular Doubly Linked List**, where each node has two pointers: `next` and `prev`.

The **Circular Linked List** in the C++ programming language is a type of linked list where the last node is connected to the first node, forming a closed loop. This means the list can be traversed indefinitely, as there is no defined start or end.

### Concept Explanation:

- **Regular Linked List**: Consists of nodes where each node points to the next, and the last node points to a null value (nullptr).
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node points to the first node instead of nullptr, creating a continuous circular structure.
- It can be either a **Singly Circular Linked List** or a **Doubly Circular Linked List**, depending on the direction of the links.

### Characteristics of a Circular Linked List:

1. **No Start or End**: Any node can be considered the starting point.
2. **Circular Traversal**: Any node can be reached from any other node by traversing the list.
3. **Applications**: Used in scenarios requiring continuous looping, such as resource management in operating systems or applications like circular playlists.

### Structure in C++:

Each node contains:

- Data.
- A pointer to the next node.

Example of defining a node for a singly circular linked list:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};
```

### Implementation of a Circular Linked List:

To create a circular linked list, ensure the last node points to the first node. Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};

class CircularLinkedList {
private:
    Node* head;

public:
    CircularLinkedList() : head(nullptr) {}

    // Insert a node at the end
    void insert(int val) {
        Node* newNode = new Node(val);
        if (head == nullptr) {
            head = newNode;
            newNode->next = head; // Node points to itself
        } else {
            Node* temp = head;
            while (temp->next != head) {
                temp = temp->next;
            }
            temp->next = newNode;
            newNode->next = head;
        }
    }

    // Display the list
    void display() {
        if (head == nullptr) {
            cout << "The list is empty" << endl;
            return;
        }
        Node* temp = head;
        do {
            cout << temp->data << " ";
            temp = temp->next;
        } while (temp != head);
        cout << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    CircularLinkedList list;
    list.insert(1);
    list.insert(2);
    list.insert(3);
    list.display(); // Output: 1 2 3
    return 0;
}
```

### Advantages of a Circular Linked List:

1. **Easy Looping**: Elements can be accessed in a cyclic manner.
2. **Flexibility**: Suitable for applications requiring repeated traversal.

### Disadvantages of a Circular Linked List:

1. **Complexity**: Operations like deletion or insertion can be more complex compared to regular linked lists.
2. **Infinite Loops**: Improper traversal control can lead to infinite loops in the code.

### Practical Applications:

- Task management in operating systems (e.g., process scheduling).
- Applications like music playlists or games requiring cyclic repetition.
- Advanced data structures like graphs or trees.

Imagine a regular linked list, where each node contains data and a pointer that points to the next node. At the end of the list, the pointer of the last node usually points to a null value (`NULL` or `nullptr`) to indicate the end of the list.

**A Circular Linked List differs in one fundamental point:** instead of the last node's pointer pointing to `NULL`, it **points back to the first node in the list**. This creates a circular loop, where you can start from any node in the list, traverse through all the other nodes, and return to the starting point.

**Here's a simplified visualization:**

```
[Node 1] --> [Node 2] --> [Node 3] --> ... --> [Last Node] --> [Node 1] ...
     ^-------------------------------------------------------------------^
```

**Features and Benefits of a Circular Linked List:**

- **No clear "end":** This property makes it useful in applications that require continuous looping or periodic processing of elements.
- **Easy circular traversal:** You can easily navigate between elements without needing to check for reaching the end of the list.
- **Specific applications:** It is suitable for representing circular data structures such as:
  - Playlists in music players.
  - Process scheduling in operating systems (Round Robin Scheduling).
  - Representing certain types of periodic algorithms.

**Potential Drawbacks:**

- **May require special care in addition and deletion operations:** You must ensure that pointers are updated correctly to maintain the circularity and avoid losing nodes.
- **May require clear termination conditions in algorithms:** When processing a circular list, you must ensure there is a mechanism to stop the iteration to avoid infinite loops.

**A simple example of how to represent a node in a circular linked list in C++:**

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;

    Node(int value) : data(value), next(nullptr) {}
};
```

In this example, `data` represents the data stored in the node, and `next` is the pointer that will point to the next node. In a circular linked list, the `next` of the last node will point to the first node.

**In conclusion:** A circular linked list is a powerful and useful data structure in specific scenarios that require a periodic nature or continuous iteration of elements. Understanding how it works and how to handle its pointers is essential for using it effectively in your C++ programs.

## Concept of Circular Linked List

A circular linked list is a special type of linked list where the last node in the list points to the first node instead of pointing to a null value. This forms a circular loop of nodes.

## Difference Between Regular and Circular Linked Lists

- In a regular Linked List: The last node points to NULL
- In a Circular Linked List: The last node points to the first node

## Advantages of Circular Linked List

1. You can traverse the list circularly without needing to start from the beginning each time
2. Useful in applications such as:
   - Task scheduling in operating systems
   - Circular game applications
   - Memory management
   - Queue implementations

## Implementing Circular Linked List in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Node structure definition
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
};

// Insert node at beginning
void insertAtBeginning(Node* &head, int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = value;

    if (head == NULL) {
        head = newNode;
        newNode->next = head; // Points to itself
    } else {
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp->next != head) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = newNode;
        newNode->next = head;
        head = newNode;
    }
}

// Insert node at end
void insertAtEnd(Node* &head, int value) {
    Node* newNode = new Node();
    newNode->data = value;

    if (head == NULL) {
        head = newNode;
        newNode->next = head;
    } else {
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp->next != head) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }
        temp->next = newNode;
        newNode->next = head;
    }
}

// Display list contents
void displayList(Node* head) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        cout << "List is empty" << endl;
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;
    do {
        cout << temp->data << " ";
        temp = temp->next;
    } while (temp != head);
    cout << endl;
}

// Delete node from beginning
void deleteFromBeginning(Node* &head) {
    if (head == NULL) {
        cout << "List is empty" << endl;
        return;
    }

    if (head->next == head) { // Only one node
        delete head;
        head = NULL;
    } else {
        Node* temp = head;
        Node* lastNode = head;
        while (lastNode->next != head) {
            lastNode = lastNode->next;
        }
        head = head->next;
        lastNode->next = head;
        delete temp;
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* head = NULL;

    insertAtBeginning(head, 10);
    insertAtBeginning(head, 20);
    insertAtEnd(head, 30);
    insertAtEnd(head, 40);

    cout << "Circular List: ";
    displayList(head); // Output: 20 10 30 40

    deleteFromBeginning(head);
    cout << "After deletion: ";
    displayList(head); // Output: 10 30 40

    return 0;
}
```

## Types of Circular Lists

1. **Singly Circular Linked List**: Each node points only to the next node
2. **Doubly Circular Linked List**: Each node points to both next and previous nodes

## Practical Applications

1. **Process Round-Robin Scheduling**: Where processes need to execute in turns
2. **Queue Implementations**: A queue can be implemented using circular linked list
3. **Games**: Like the Josephus problem where people in a circle are eliminated in a specific order

## Warnings

1. Be careful of infinite loops when working with circular linked lists
2. When traversing the list, use appropriate termination conditions (like using do-while as shown in the example)

# Circular Linked List in C++

A circular linked list is a special type of linked list where the last node points to the first node, creating a loop. This differs from regular linked lists which typically end with a NULL pointer.

## Characteristics of Circular Linked Lists:

1. No node has a NULL pointer (there is no end)
2. Any node can be accessed from any other node in the list
3. Can be singly linked (each node points to the next) or doubly linked (each node points to both previous and next)

## Implementation of Circular Linked List in C++:

### Basic Structure:

```cpp
// Node structure definition
struct Node {
    int data;           // Data stored in the node
    Node* next;         // Pointer to the next node
};

// Circular Linked List class
class CircularLinkedList {
private:
    Node* head;         // Pointer to the first node (or any node in the list)

public:
    // Constructor
    CircularLinkedList() {
        head = NULL;
    }

    // Basic functions for the list
    void insert(int value);
    void remove(int value);
    void display();
    bool isEmpty();
};
```

### Implementation of Basic Functions:

#### 1. Inserting a new node:

```cpp
void CircularLinkedList::insert(int value) {
    // Create a new node
    Node* newNode = new Node;
    newNode->data = value;

    // If the list is empty
    if (head == NULL) {
        head = newNode;
        newNode->next = head;  // Node points to itself
    }
    // If the list is not empty
    else {
        Node* temp = head;

        // Move to the last node
        while (temp->next != head) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        // Make the last node point to the new node
        temp->next = newNode;
        // Make the new node point to the head
        newNode->next = head;
    }
}
```

#### 2. Displaying the list:

```cpp
void CircularLinkedList::display() {
    if (head == NULL) {
        cout << "List is empty" << endl;
        return;
    }

    Node* temp = head;

    do {
        cout << temp->data << " -> ";
        temp = temp->next;
    } while (temp != head);

    cout << "Back to start" << endl;
}
```

#### 3. Removing a node:

```cpp
void CircularLinkedList::remove(int value) {
    // If the list is empty
    if (head == NULL) {
        cout << "List is empty, cannot delete" << endl;
        return;
    }

    Node* current = head;
    Node* previous = NULL;

    // Search for the node to be deleted
    while (current->data != value) {
        // If we've reached the end of the list without finding the value
        if (current->next == head) {
            cout << "Value not found in the list" << endl;
            return;
        }

        previous = current;
        current = current->next;
    }

    // If the list contains only one node
    if (current->next == head && current == head) {
        head = NULL;
        delete current;
        return;
    }

    // If the node to be deleted is the head
    if (current == head) {
        // Find the last node
        Node* temp = head;
        while (temp->next != head) {
            temp = temp->next;
        }

        head = current->next;  // Update head to be the next node
        temp->next = head;     // Make the last node point to the new head
    }
    // If the node to be deleted is the last node
    else if (current->next == head) {
        previous->next = head;  // Make the previous node point to the head
    }
    // If the node to be deleted is in the middle
    else {
        previous->next = current->next;  // Bypass the current node
    }

    delete current;  // Free the memory
}
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Circular Linked Lists:

### Advantages:

- Can traverse all nodes starting from any node
- Useful in applications like player turn rotation and process scheduling
- No need to check for the end of the list as it is continuous

### Disadvantages:

- More complex to implement than regular linked lists
- Care must be taken to avoid infinite loops when traversing the list

## Practical Applications:

- Process scheduling in operating systems
- Implementation of data structures like Circular Buffer
- Games that require player rotation
- Multimedia applications that need continuous playback
