**INFO 1: "Linked List (Recursion)"**

"A Linked List is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer (or reference) to the next node in the list. When utilizing recursion in a Linked List, there is a sequence of functions that navigate and interact with the nodes within the list.

Let's explain how recursion can be used to traverse a Linked List:

Let's assume we have a `Node` structure representing a node in the Linked List:

```cpp
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;

    // Constructor
    Node(int val) : data(val), next(nullptr) {}
};
```

Assuming we have a Linked List:

```cpp
Node* head = new Node(1);
head->next = new Node(2);
head->next->next = new Node(3);
head->next->next->next = new Node(4);
// ...
```

Now, let's implement a function using recursion to print the nodes in the Linked List:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

void printLinkedList(Node* current) {
    // Base case: Check for the end of the list
    if (current == nullptr) {
        std::cout << "End of the Linked List\n";
        return;
    }

    // Print data of the current node
    std::cout << current->data << " ";

    // Recursive case: Move to the next node in the list
    printLinkedList(current->next);
}

int main() {
    // Print the Linked List starting from the head
    printLinkedList(head);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `printLinkedList` function uses recursion to print the data of the nodes in the Linked List. The function starts from the current node and moves to the next node using recursion until it reaches the end of the list.

This is a simple example, and recursion can be integrated into various types of operations such as addition, deletion, or searching in the Linked List." **(ChatGpt)**
