**INFO 1: "Trees"**

"In C++, the term "trees" refers to a data structure consisting of elements organized sequentially and hierarchically in a tree-like structure, where each element typically has a relationship with other elements resembling branches and nodes in a tree. The elements in the tree are usually referred to as "nodes," and they are organized in a way that allows quick access to the data.

Trees are used in programming to organize data in a manner that facilitates efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. There are different types of trees, such as Binary Trees, which can contain only two elements per node, and Multiway Trees, which can contain more than two elements per node.

Trees are used in various applications, including implementing different data structures such as binary search trees and multiway trees for organizing data sequentially, as well as in other applications such as organizational operations and hierarchical data presentation." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Trees"**

"Tree Concept in C++
In C++, a Tree is a non-linear data structure used to store elements in a hierarchical manner. It consists of a set of nodes interconnected with each other.

Tree Advantages:

Efficiency: Trees are highly efficient for searching, adding, and deleting operations.
Speed: Trees are faster than other data structures like linked lists when performing search, add, and delete operations.
Versatility: Trees can be used in various applications such as data storage, implementing search algorithms, and many more.
Types of Trees:

Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two child nodes (left and right).
AVL Tree: A balanced binary tree with constant height.
Red-Black Tree: A balanced binary tree with specific properties that guarantee high efficiency for search, add, and delete operations.
Tree Applications:

Data Storage: Trees can be used to store data in a non-linear manner.
Implementing Search Algorithms: Trees can be used to implement certain search algorithms like Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS).
Queue Simulation: Trees can be used to simulate queues where elements can be added to the end of the queue and deleted from the beginning of the queue." **(Gemini)**
