**INFO 1: "Binary Search Tree (BST) - Delete Node"**

"In C++, the concept of "BST Delete Node" refers to the operation of removing a node from a Binary Search Tree (BST). A binary search tree is a data structure characterized by a specific ordering, where values smaller than the root value are stored in the left subtree, and values greater are stored in the right subtree.

When deleting a node from a binary search tree, it is essential to maintain the tree's sorted nature according to the requirements of this type of tree. The algorithm used to delete the node should consider several possible cases, such as:

1. If the node containing the value to be deleted has no children, it can be removed directly.
2. If the node has only one child, it can be replaced with its child.
3. If the node has two children, it can be replaced with a suitable substitute from the right subtree (or the left subtree if there is no right child) by selecting the smallest value in the right subtree (or the largest value in the left subtree), swapping it with the node to be deleted, and then deleting the selected node from the tree.

Implementing the deletion operation of a node from a binary search tree typically requires using recursion to navigate the tree and apply the correct algorithm for each specific case." **(ChatGPT)**
