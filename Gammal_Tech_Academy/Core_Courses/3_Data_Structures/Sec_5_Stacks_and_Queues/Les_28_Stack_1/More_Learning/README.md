**INFO 1: "Stack"**

"A Stack is a type of data structure that follows the "Last In, First Out" or "LIFO" principle, meaning that the last element added is the first one to be removed. You can imagine a Stack as a pile of books, where each new book is placed on top of the pile, and books are taken off from the top.

A Stack has two fundamental operations:

1. **Push:** Places a new element on top of the Stack.
2. **Pop:** Removes the element from the top of the Stack.

Additionally, there's an operation called **Peek:** which looks at the element on the top of the Stack without removing it.

In the C++ programming language, the `std::stack` data structure can be used to implement a Stack. Here's a simple example demonstrating its usage:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>

int main() {
    // Create a Stack
    std::stack<int> myStack;

    // Add elements to the Stack using Push
    myStack.push(1);
    myStack.push(2);
    myStack.push(3);

    // Remove the top element using Pop
    myStack.pop();

    // Peek at the top element without removing it
    int topElement = myStack.top();

    // Print the remaining elements in the Stack
    std::cout << "Stack elements: ";
    while (!myStack.empty()) {
        std::cout << myStack.top() << " ";
        myStack.pop();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::stack` is used to create a Stack and perform basic operations like `push`, `pop`, and `top`." **(ChatGPT)**

"**What is a Stack?**

A stack is an abstract data structure that resembles a stack of plates. Items are stored in the stack from top to bottom and are accessed in the same order.

**How does the Stack work?**

**1. Push Operation:**

* A new item is added to the top of the stack.
* This item becomes the "top" item in the stack.

**2. Pop Operation:**

* The "top" item is removed from the stack.
* The item that was below it becomes the new "top" item.

**LIFO Principle:**

The stack is known by the "Last In First Out" (LIFO) principle, which means that the last item added is the first item removed.

**Example of using the Stack:**

* Storing internet browsing history.
* Undoing actions in a program.
* Evaluating mathematical expressions.

**Stack Features:**

* Ease of use.
* Memory efficiency.
* Ease of implementation.

**Stack Disadvantages:**

* Slow random access.
* Management complexity.

**Examples of Stack Structures in Programming Languages:**

* `std::stack` in C++
* `List` in Python
* `ArrayDeque` in Java

**Note:**

* There are many Arabic references online that explain the stack in detail, such as the Academy of Computing website and the Informatics website.
* You can also find many examples of using the stack in different programming languages online." **(Gemini)**
