**INFO 1: "Queue"**

"In C++, a Queue is a type of data structure that operates on the "First In, First Out" (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the Queue is the first one to be removed. A Queue can be envisioned as a real-life queue or line, where elements are added at the end of the line and removed from the front.

In C++, the `std::queue` data structure can be used to implement a Queue. `std::queue` relies on the underlying data structure `std::deque` (double-ended queue) and provides a convenient interface for adding elements to the end of the Queue (using `push`) and removing them from the front (using `pop`).

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use a Queue in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

int main() {
    // Create a Queue to store integers
    std::queue<int> myQueue;

    // Add elements to the Queue using push
    myQueue.push(1);
    myQueue.push(2);
    myQueue.push(3);

    // Extract and print elements from the Queue using pop
    while (!myQueue.empty()) {
        std::cout << myQueue.front() << " ";  // Front element
        myQueue.pop();
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `std::queue` is used to create a Queue to store integers. Elements are added using `push`, and they are extracted and printed using `front` and `pop`." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Queue"**

"**What is a Queue?**

A queue is an abstract data structure that resembles a waiting line in real life. Items are stored in the queue from front to back and are accessed in the same order.

**How does a Queue work?**

**1. Enqueue Operation:**

* A new item is added to the end of the queue.
* This item becomes the "last" item in the queue.

**2. Dequeue Operation:**

* The "first" item is removed from the queue.
* The item that was after it becomes the new "first" item.

**FIFO Principle:**

The queue is known by the "First In First Out" (FIFO) principle, which means that the first item added is the first item removed.

**Example of using a Queue:**

* Storing a print queue.
* Storing messages in a messaging system.
* Storing items to be processed later.

**Advantages of Queue:**

* Ease of use.
* Memory efficiency.
* Ease of implementation.

**Disadvantages of Queue:**

* Slow random access.
* Management complexity.

**Examples of Queue Structures in C++ Programming Language:**

* `std::queue`
* `std::deque`
* `std::list`

**Note:**

* There are many Arabic references online that explain the queue in detail, such as the Academy of Computing website and the Informatics website.
* You can also find many examples of using the queue in C++ programming language online.

**I hope this explanation is helpful.**

**Detailed Explanation of Queue Operations:**

* **Enqueue:**

```c++
// Add an element to the queue
queue.push(element);
```

* **Dequeue:**

```c++
// Remove and return the front element
element = queue.front();
queue.pop();
```

* **Check if the queue is empty:**

```c++
bool empty = queue.empty();
```

* **Get the number of elements in the queue:**

```c++
int size = queue.size();
```

**Note:**

* `std::deque` or `std::list` can also be used to implement the queue, but with some differences in how they work.

**Examples of using Queue:**

* **Storing a print queue:**

```c++
std::queue<std::string> printQueue;

// Add documents to the print queue
printQueue.push("Document 1");
printQueue.push("Document 2");
printQueue.push("Document 3");

// Print documents until the queue is empty
while (!printQueue.empty()) {
    std::cout << printQueue.front() << std::endl;
    printQueue.pop();
}
```

* **Storing messages in a messaging system:**

```c++
std::queue<std::string> messageQueue;

// Add messages to the message queue
messageQueue.push("Hello");
messageQueue.push("How are you?");
messageQueue.push("I am doing well");

// Send messages until the queue is empty
while (!messageQueue.empty()) {
    std::cout << messageQueue.front() << std::endl;
    messageQueue.pop();
}
```

**I hope this explanation has helped you better understand the concept of Queue in C++ programming language.**" **(Gemini)**
