**INFO 1: "Double Ended Queue"**

"In C++, a Deque is a data structure similar to a Queue but allows fast access to elements at both the beginning and the end of the structure. Short for "Double Ended Queue," it's designed to support efficient addition and removal from both ends.

In other words, you can add and remove elements from the front or back of the Deque efficiently, and access elements anywhere in the Deque with constant time complexity (O(1)), regardless of the Deque's size.

Deque can be used in various scenarios where the program requires frequent addition and removal of data from either end, such as implementing data processing algorithms, depth-first search, or linear arrangements." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Double Ended Queue"**

"In C++, Deque (Double Ended Queue) is a dynamic data structure that can be expanded or contracted on both ends (front or back). It allows fast insertion and deletion of elements at both ends.

**Deque Features:**

* **Efficiency:** Deque is highly efficient for adding and deleting elements from both ends.
* **Speed:** Deque is faster than other data structures like linked lists when adding and deleting elements from both ends.
* **Versatility:** Deque can be used in various applications such as caching data, implementing search algorithms, and many more.

**Deque Applications:**

* **Caching Data:** Deque can be used to cache data in memory for easy access, addition, and deletion from both ends.
* **Implementing Search Algorithms:** Deque can be used to implement certain search algorithms like Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS).
* **Simulating Queues:** Deque can be used to simulate queues where elements can be added to the end of the queue and deleted from the beginning of the queue.

**Deque Disadvantages:**

* **Complexity:** Using Deque can be more complex than other data structures like arrays and linked lists.
* **Memory Consumption:** Deque may consume more memory compared to other data structures like arrays." **(Gemini)**
