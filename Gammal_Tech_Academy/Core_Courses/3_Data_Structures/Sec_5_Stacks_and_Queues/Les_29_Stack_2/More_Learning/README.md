**INFO 1: "Container Adapters"**

"In C++, the term "Container Adapters" refers to a type of data structures that provide a specific interface to organize and control access to underlying data structures such as Stack, Queue, and Priority Queue. These terms represent interfaces built on list-based data structures like List or Deque and offer specialized interfaces for specific purposes.

Here are three main Container Adapters terms in C++:

1. **std::stack:**
   - Used to implement the Stack data structure.
   - Provides basic operations such as push, pop, and top.

2. **std::queue:**
   - Used to implement the Queue data structure.
   - Provides basic operations such as push, pop, front, and back.

3. **std::priority_queue:**
   - Used to implement the Priority Queue data structure.
   - Provides interfaces allowing the insertion of elements with certain priorities and extracting elements according to those priorities.

These Container Adapter terms are useful when you need to use a specific data structure for a particular type of operations and want to use a more abstract interface without dealing directly with the details of the underlying data structure." **(ChatGPT)**
