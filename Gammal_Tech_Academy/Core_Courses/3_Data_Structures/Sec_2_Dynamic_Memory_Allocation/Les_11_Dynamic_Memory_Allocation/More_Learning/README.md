### üåü First: Static Memory Allocation

**Meaning: Memory is allocated at compile time.**

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:

- Memory is reserved **during compilation**.
- Faster than dynamic allocation.
- No need for manual management (no `malloc` or `free`).

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages:

- Memory size **cannot be changed** during runtime.
- Might allocate more or less memory than needed, since the exact size isn‚Äôt always predictable.

#### üéØ Example:

```c
int arr[100]; // 100 memory cells are allocated statically
```

### üîÑ Second: Dynamic Memory Allocation

**Meaning: Memory is allocated at runtime.**

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:

- More flexible ‚Äî you can allocate memory as needed.
- Suitable for structures like linked lists.

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages:

- Slightly slower than static allocation.
- Requires **manual memory management** (allocate and free), otherwise, it could lead to memory leaks.

#### üéØ Example:

```c
int* arr = (int*)malloc(100 * sizeof(int)); // Allocate 100 cells dynamically
```

> And don‚Äôt forget to:

```c
free(arr); // Free the allocated memory
```

### üîç Quick Comparison:

| Comparison        | Static Memory | Dynamic Memory       |
| ----------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Allocation Time   | Compile time  | Runtime              |
| Size Flexibility  | Fixed         | Flexible             |
| Memory Management | Automatic     | Manual (malloc/free) |
| Speed             | Faster        | Slightly slower      |

### **1. Static Memory Allocation:**

- **Definition:** Memory is allocated to variables during code writing and before the program runs (i.e., at Compile Time).
- **How it works:** When you declare a variable (e.g., `int x = 10;`) in a language like C or C++, the required memory size is determined in advance and reserved in static memory (usually the Stack).
- **Characteristics:**
  - The size is fixed and cannot be changed during program execution.
  - Memory is automatically freed when the variable goes out of scope.
  - Faster because it doesn‚Äôt require manual management.
- **Example:**
  ```c
  int array[5]; // The array size is fixed at 5 elements
  ```
  Here, memory is allocated for only 5 elements, and you cannot increase the size later.
- **Disadvantages:** Inflexible; if you need a larger or smaller size during runtime, you can‚Äôt modify it.

### **2. Dynamic Memory Allocation:**

- **Definition:** Memory is allocated during program execution (Run Time) as needed.
- **How it works:** Special functions (like `malloc` or `new` in C/C++) are used to request memory from the Heap, and it can be manually freed (e.g., with `free` or `delete`).
- **Characteristics:**
  - The size is flexible and can be changed (increased or decreased) during runtime.
  - Requires manual management to avoid memory leaks.
  - Relatively slower compared to static allocation due to additional operations.
- **Example:**
  ```c
  int *array = (int*)malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory for 5 elements
  array = (int*)realloc(array, 10 * sizeof(int)); // Resize to 10 elements
  free(array); // Manually free the memory
  ```
  Here, you can control the memory size as needed.
- **Disadvantages:** Can complicate the code or lead to issues like memory leaks if memory isn‚Äôt freed properly.

### **Key Differences in Brief:**

| Aspect                | Static Allocation       | Dynamic Allocation       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Allocation Time**   | Compile Time            | Run Time                 |
| **Memory Location**   | Stack                   | Heap                     |
| **Flexibility**       | Inflexible (fixed size) | Flexible (variable size) |
| **Speed**             | Faster                  | Slower                   |
| **Memory Management** | Automatic               | Manual                   |

### **When to Use Each?**

- **Static:** When you know the required size in advance and it won‚Äôt change (e.g., simple variables or small arrays).
- **Dynamic:** When you need flexibility in size or don‚Äôt know the required size until runtime (e.g., large lists or variable data).

**Static Memory Allocation**

- **Allocation Time**: Memory is allocated at compile time.
- **Size**: The required memory size is fixed and known in advance.
- **Flexibility**: Inflexible, as the memory size cannot be changed during program execution.
- **Location**: Memory is typically allocated in the static memory area.
- **Uses**: Used for global variables, static variables, and fixed-size arrays.
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster than dynamic memory allocation.
  - Simpler to manage.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Limits program flexibility.
  - May lead to memory waste if a large size is allocated but not fully used.

**Dynamic Memory Allocation**

- **Allocation Time**: Memory is allocated during program execution (run time).
- **Size**: The required memory size can be changed during program execution.
- **Flexibility**: Flexible, as memory can be allocated and deallocated as needed.
- **Location**: Memory is typically allocated in the heap area.
- **Uses**: Used for variable-size arrays, dynamic structures such as linked lists and trees.
- **Advantages**:
  - Increases program flexibility.
  - Allows for efficient memory usage.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Slower than static memory allocation.
  - More complex to manage, requiring the use of pointers.
  - The programmer must deallocate memory after use to avoid memory leaks.

**Summary**

- Static memory allocation is suitable for cases where the required memory size is known in advance and fixed.
- Dynamic memory allocation is suitable for cases where the required memory size is unknown in advance or variable.
