# Data Structures ..

### Data Structures are fundamental in computer science, serving as an efficient means to organize and store data in specific ways. They enhance program performance and efficiency by providing effective methods for searching, inserting, and deleting data. Data Structures help solve a wide range of problems, whether simple or complex, and improve algorithm efficiency. By using appropriate Data Structures, resource consumption and execution time can be optimized. Common examples of Data Structures include arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tables. Data Structures are a crucial tool for software engineers to achieve effective design and enhance application performance.
