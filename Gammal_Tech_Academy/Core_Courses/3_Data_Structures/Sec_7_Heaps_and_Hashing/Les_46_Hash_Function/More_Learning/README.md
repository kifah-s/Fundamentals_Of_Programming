**INFO 1: "Hash Function"**

"In the C++ programming language, a Hash function is a function that takes an input (such as a string or data sequence) and converts it into a hash value, typically an integer. Hash functions are used in data structures like hash tables and hash maps to store data and accelerate search and insertion operations.

The quality and efficiency of a hash function depend on its ability to evenly distribute values across the hash value space and avoid collisions between different values. Good hash functions should be computationally fast and minimize the number of collisions between different values.

Hash functions are used in various applications, including databases, data verification, digital signature schemes, encryption systems, and other areas that require converting data into hash values for processing, storage, or verification." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Hash Function"**

"A **hash function** is an algorithm that takes an input of arbitrary length (such as a text string or a file) and produces a fixed-length value (called a "hash" or "digest").

**Hash Function Properties:**

- **Produces a fixed-length value:** A hash function produces a value of fixed length regardless of the input length.
- **Uniform distribution:** A hash function distributes the hashed values uniformly over the range of possible values.
- **Efficiency:** A hash function should be fast to compute.
- **Collision avoidance:** A hash function should produce different hashed values for different inputs as much as possible.

**Advantages of Using Hash Functions:**

- **Efficient searching:** Hash functions are used to search for data in data structures such as hash tables.
- **Data integrity verification:** Hash functions are used to verify the integrity of data, such as ensuring that a file has not been changed since it was last checked.
- **Efficient storage:** Hash functions are used to store data efficiently, such as storing files in a file system.

**Disadvantages of Using Hash Functions:**

- **Hash collisions:** A hash function may produce the same hashed value for different inputs, which can lead to problems when searching for data.
- **Insecurity:** Hash functions can be used to create security attacks, such as "collision" attacks.

**Examples of Using Hash Functions:**

- **Hash tables:** A hash function is used to calculate the index of an element in a hash table.
- **File checksums:** A hash function is used to calculate the "checksum" of a file, which is then compared to a stored checksum to verify the file's integrity.
- **Digital signatures:** A hash function is used to create a digital signature for a file, which is then used to verify the authenticity of the file.

**Note:** Hash functions are a powerful tool for storing and searching data,

**Terminology Explanation:**

- **Input:** The data that is fed into the hash function.
- **Hashed value:** The value that is output by the hash function.
- **Hash collision:** When a hash function produces the same hashed value for different inputs.

**Note:** The terminology used to describe hash functions may vary in some sources." **(Gemini)**
