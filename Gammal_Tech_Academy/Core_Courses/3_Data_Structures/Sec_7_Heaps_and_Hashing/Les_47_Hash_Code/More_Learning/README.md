**INFO 1: "Hash Code"**

"In the C++ programming language, the concept of "hash code" refers to a condensed value (typically numeric) used to represent larger data, such as a string or a complex object. This value serves as a unique signature for the given data.

A hash function is used to generate the hash code. A hash function is a process that takes data as input and outputs a specific hash code value. Generating a hash code is typically a fast and efficient process, converting large data into a fixed-size value.

A good hash function should provide the following properties:

1. **Uniqueness**: Each different piece of data should have a different hash code.
2. **Low collision**: Collisions (where different data produce the same hash code) should be rare.

Common uses of hash codes in C++ include:

1. **Data structure lookups**: Such as hash tables, where a hash code value can be used for quick data access.
2. **Data signing**: Hash codes can be used as unique signatures for files or data, allowing for integrity checks.

Note: The hash function should be efficiently executable, preferably also being avalanche-effect, meaning a small change in input data should lead to a significant change in the hash code value." **(ChatGPT)**

"**What is a hash code?**

A hash code is a numerical value used to represent data in partitioned data structures such as hash tables. This value is calculated using a function called a hash function on the data key.

**Advantages of using hash codes:**

* **Speed:** It greatly facilitates the process of searching for data in partitioned data structures.
* **Efficiency:** It significantly reduces memory usage.

**Disadvantages of using hash codes:**

* **Collision:** The hash function may produce the same value for multiple different keys.
* **Lack of order:** Partitioned data structures do not maintain the order of the data.

**Explanation of the hash function:**

* The hash function is used to convert the data key to a numerical value.
* The hash function must be well-distributed, meaning that it produces values evenly distributed over the range of possible values.
* There are many types of hash functions, such as MD5 and SHA-1.

**Using hash codes in C++:**

* The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) provides many classes that use hash codes, such as `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set`.
* You can also write your own hash function.

**Note:**

* It is preferable to use hash codes with data that has specific properties, such as data with unique keys.
* The hash function should be well-tested to ensure that it produces evenly distributed values." **(Gemini)**
