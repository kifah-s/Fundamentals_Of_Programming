**INFO 1: "Hash Table"**

"In the C++ programming language, a "hash table" is defined as a data structure that uses a hash function to efficiently store and retrieve elements. The design of the table relies on converting data keys into indices using a hash function, and with these indices, data is stored in an appropriate location within the data structure for easy access.

There are basic steps in using hash tables:

1. **Generating the Hash Code**: The data key is used as input to a hash function to generate a hash code.
2. **Storing Data**: The hash code value is used as an index to determine the storage location of the data within the table.
3. **Searching and Accessing Data**: When searching for specific data, a hash code is generated for the search key and used to determine the location of the data in the table, allowing for immediate access.

Advantages of hash tables include fast access to data (under normal circumstances) and the ability to efficiently store large sets of data. However, inefficient hash functions can lead to collisions, where different keys generate the same hash code, requiring special strategies to handle these cases, such as using linked lists in each cell of the table to deal with collisions.

In C++, hash tables can be implemented using a variety of data structures, such as `std::unordered_map` in the Standard Template Library (STL)." **(ChatGPT)**

**INFO 2: "Hash Table"**

"**What is a hash table?**

A hash table is a data structure used to store data in key-value pairs. A hash function is used to convert the data key to an index in an array. The data value is then stored at that index.

**Advantages of using a hash table:**

* **Speed:** It greatly facilitates the process of searching for data.
* **Efficiency:** It significantly reduces memory usage.

**Disadvantages of using a hash table:**

* **Collision:** The hash function may produce the same index for multiple different keys.
* **Lack of order:** Hash tables do not maintain the order of the data.

**How does a hash table work?**

1. **Calculating the key index:** The hash function is used to calculate the index of the key in the array.
2. **Handling collision:** If there is a collision, one of the following methods is used:
    * **Linear probing:** Search for the next available index in the array.
    * **Quadratic probing:** Search for the next available index in the array using a quadratic sequence.
    * **Chaining:** Store all colliding values in a linked list.
3. **Accessing data:** The key index is used to access the data value in the array.

**Using hash tables in C++:**

* The C++ STL (Standard Template Library) provides several classes that use hash tables, such as `std::unordered_map` and `std::unordered_set`.
* You can also write your own hash function.

**Note:**

* It is preferable to use hash tables with data that has specific properties, such as data with unique keys.
* The hash function should be well-tested to ensure that it produces evenly distributed values." **(Gemini)**
