In **C++**, the keywords `new` and `delete` are used for **dynamic memory management**. Here’s a simple and clear explanation of each:

## ✅ `new`: Allocates Memory Dynamically

`new` is used to allocate memory on the **heap** during runtime.

### Syntax:

```cpp
int* ptr = new int;        // Allocates a single integer
int* arr = new int[10];    // Allocates an array of 10 integers
```

### What does `new` do?

- Allocates space in memory.
- Returns a pointer to the allocated memory.
- Optionally initializes the value.

### Example:

```cpp
int* num = new int;    // Allocates memory for an integer
*num = 5;              // Stores 5 in the allocated memory
```

## ❌ `delete`: Frees Allocated Memory

`delete` is used to **free memory** allocated using `new`, to prevent **memory leaks**.

### Syntax:

```cpp
delete ptr;       // For a single variable
delete[] arr;     // For an array
```

### Important Notes:

- Use `delete` only with memory allocated using `new`.
- Use `delete[]` when `new[]` was used.

## Full Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* ptr = new int;   // Allocate memory
    *ptr = 42;
    cout << *ptr << endl; // Output the value

    delete ptr;           // Free the memory
    ptr = nullptr;        // Avoid dangling pointer

    return 0;
}
```

## Common Mistakes:

1. Using `delete` on memory not allocated with `new`.
2. Forgetting to use `delete` → leads to **memory leaks**.
3. Using `delete` twice on the same pointer → causes **undefined behavior**.

In the C++ programming language, the concepts of `new` and `delete` are used for dynamic memory management, i.e., allocating and deallocating memory manually during program execution. I’ll explain each concept in a simplified manner:

### 1. **Concept: `new`**

- **Purpose**: The `new` operator is used to allocate dynamic memory from the heap to store an object or an array.
- **How it works**:
  - It allocates the required amount of memory to store the requested object or data.
  - It returns the address of the allocated memory (a pointer) to the variable used to access this memory.
- **Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  pointer = new type;
  ```
  Or for allocating an array:
  ```cpp
  pointer = new type[size];
  ```
- **Example**:

  ```cpp
  int* ptr = new int; // Allocate memory for an int variable
  *ptr = 10; // Assign a value
  cout << *ptr << endl; // Print the value
  ```

  For allocating an array:

  ```cpp
  int* arr = new int[5]; // Allocate memory for an array of 5 integers
  arr[0] = 1; // Assign a value
  ```

### 2. **Concept: `delete`**

- **Purpose**: The `delete` operator is used to deallocate memory previously allocated with `new`, freeing the memory and preventing memory leaks.
- **How it works**:
  - It removes the object or array from memory and returns it to the system for reuse.
  - After using `delete`, the pointer becomes "dangling," so it’s preferable to set it to `nullptr`.
- **Syntax**:
  ```cpp
  delete pointer; // Free memory for a single object
  ```
  Or to free an array:
  ```cpp
  delete[] pointer; // Free memory for an array
  ```
- **Example**:

  ```cpp
  int* ptr = new int; // Allocate memory
  *ptr = 10;
  delete ptr; // Free the memory
  ptr = nullptr; // Avoid dangling pointer
  ```

  For an array:

  ```cpp
  int* arr = new int[5]; // Allocate an array
  delete[] arr; // Free the memory
  arr = nullptr;
  ```

### **Important Notes**:

1. **Memory Leak**: If you don’t use `delete` to free memory allocated with `new`, the memory remains reserved until the program ends, causing a memory leak.
2. **Use `delete` only with `new`**: Don’t use `delete` to free memory not allocated with `new`, as this can cause undefined behavior.
3. **Difference between `delete` and `delete[]`**:
   - `delete` is used for a single object.
   - `delete[]` is used for an array, ensuring the destructor is called for each element in the array if it contains objects.
4. **Dangling Pointers**: After `delete`, set the pointer to `nullptr` to avoid accessing invalid memory.

### **Comprehensive Example**:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Allocate memory for a single integer
    int* ptr = new int;
    *ptr = 20;
    cout << "Value: " << *ptr << endl;

    // Free the memory
    delete ptr;
    ptr = nullptr;

    // Allocate memory for an array
    int* arr = new int[3];
    arr[0] = 1;
    arr[1] = 2;
    arr[2] = 3;

    // Print array elements
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        cout << "arr[" << i << "] = " << arr[i] << endl;
    }

    // Free the array memory
    delete[] arr;
    arr = nullptr;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Summary**:

- `new`: Allocates dynamic memory and returns a pointer to it.
- `delete`: Frees memory allocated with `new` to prevent memory leaks.
- Use them carefully, managing pointers to avoid errors like accessing invalid memory.

In the C++ programming language, the concepts of `new` and `delete` are fundamental for dynamic memory management.

**The `new` Concept (Dynamic Allocation)**

The `new` operator is used to allocate memory _during_ the program's execution (in an area known as the "heap"). Unlike variables declared within or outside a function (for which memory is automatically allocated in the "stack"), `new` gives you manual control over when and where memory is allocated.

**How `new` Works:**

1.  **Determines the required memory size:** Based on the data type you specify after `new` (such as `int`, `char`, an object of a specific class, etc.), the `new` operator calculates the amount of memory needed to store that type.

2.  **Searches for sufficient space in the heap:** The operating system looks for a contiguous block of memory in the heap that is large enough to satisfy the request.

3.  **Allocates the memory:** If sufficient space is found, `new` reserves this block of memory for use.

4.  **Returns a pointer:** The `new` operator returns a _pointer_ to the beginning of the newly allocated memory block. This pointer must be stored in a pointer variable of the appropriate type.

**Example of using `new`:**

```c++
int* ptrInt; // Declare a pointer to store the address of an integer
ptrInt = new int; // Allocate space in memory to store an integer and return its address to ptrInt

char* ptrChar = new char[20]; // Allocate space for 20 characters and return the address of the first character

class MyClass {
public:
    int data;
    MyClass() : data(0) {}
};

MyClass* ptrObject = new MyClass(); // Create a dynamic object of the MyClass class and return a pointer to it
```

**The `delete` Concept (Memory Deallocation)**

When you are finished using the memory you allocated with `new`, it is very important to release it using the `delete` operator. Failure to release memory that is no longer in use leads to what is known as a "memory leak," where the reserved memory continues to occupy space in the heap, potentially leading to system slowdown or even failure.

**How `delete` Works:**

1.  **Receives a pointer:** The `delete` operator takes a pointer to the beginning of the memory block that was previously allocated using `new`.

2.  **Informs the operating system:** `delete` informs the operating system that the memory block pointed to by the pointer is no longer in use and can be made available for future allocations.

3.  **Releases the memory:** The operating system deallocates the memory block.

**There are two forms of `delete`:**

- **`delete pointer;`**: Used to deallocate memory that was allocated for a single element (such as `new int` or `new MyClass`).

- **`delete[] pointer;`**: Used to deallocate memory that was allocated for an array (using `new[]` such as `new char[20]`). It is crucial to use `delete[]` to deallocate memory allocated with `new[]` to avoid undefined behavior.

**Example of using `delete`:**

```c++
delete ptrInt;     // Deallocate the memory pointed to by ptrInt
ptrInt = nullptr;  // It's good practice to set the pointer to nullptr after deletion to prevent accidental use

delete[] ptrChar;  // Deallocate the memory pointed to by ptrChar

delete ptrObject;  // Deallocate the memory pointed to by ptrObject
```

**Important Points to Remember:**

- **Use `delete` for every `new`:** Every time you use `new` to allocate memory, you must have a corresponding `delete` to release that memory when it is no longer needed.
- **Use `delete[]` with `new[]`:** If you allocated memory for an array using `new[]`, you must deallocate it using `delete[]`. Using just `delete` in this case leads to undefined behavior.
- **Do not try to delete the same memory twice:** Attempting to deallocate the same block of memory using `delete` or `delete[]` twice results in a runtime error.
- **Do not try to delete memory that was not allocated with `new`:** Attempting to deallocate memory that was automatically created (such as local variables) using `delete` results in an error.
- **Set pointers to `nullptr` after deletion:** After deallocating memory, it is good practice to set the pointer that was pointing to it to `nullptr`. This helps prevent errors resulting from trying to access memory that has already been freed (known as "dangling pointers").

**Why Use `new` and `delete`?**

- **Managing memory size at runtime:** Allows you to determine the size of memory the program needs based on actual conditions during execution. For example, you can allocate memory for an array based on user input.
- **Creating objects that persist longer than the function scope:** Objects created using `new` can continue to exist even after the function that created them has finished, as long as there is a pointer pointing to them.
- **Implementing dynamic data structures:** `new` and `delete` are essential for implementing dynamic data structures such as linked lists, trees, and graphs, where the size of these structures can change during program execution.

In C++, `new` and `delete` are used for **manual dynamic memory management**. Below is a detailed explanation of each:

### **1. The `new` Operator**

- **Purpose**: Used to **dynamically allocate memory** (from the Heap) during runtime.
- **When to use?** When you need to create an object or variable whose size is not known at compile time (e.g., variable-length arrays).
- **Key Features**:
  - Returns a **pointer** to the allocated memory address.
  - Can allocate memory for **primitive types** (like `int`, `float`) or **objects**.

#### **Examples:**

- **Allocating memory for a single variable:**

  ```cpp
  int *ptr = new int;  // Allocates memory for an int
  *ptr = 10;           // Stores the value 10
  ```

- **Allocating memory for an array:**

  ```cpp
  int *arr = new int[5]; // Allocates memory for an array of 5 integers
  arr[0] = 1;            // Assigns 1 to the first element
  ```

- **Allocating memory for an object:**
  ```cpp
  class MyClass {};
  MyClass *obj = new MyClass(); // Allocates memory for a MyClass object
  ```

### **2. The `delete` Operator**

- **Purpose**: Used to **free dynamically allocated memory** to prevent **memory leaks**.
- **When to use?** When the allocated memory is no longer needed.
- **Warning**: Forgetting `delete` leads to **memory leaks** (wasted memory).

#### **Examples:**

- **Freeing memory for a single variable:**

  ```cpp
  int *ptr = new int;
  *ptr = 10;
  delete ptr; // Releases the memory
  ```

- **Freeing memory for an array:**

  ```cpp
  int *arr = new int[5];
  delete[] arr; // Note: Use delete[] for arrays
  ```

- **Freeing memory for an object:**
  ```cpp
  MyClass *obj = new MyClass();
  delete obj; // Releases the object's memory
  ```

### **Complete Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Allocate memory for an integer
    int *num = new int;
    *num = 100;
    cout << *num << endl; // Output: 100

    // Allocate memory for an array
    int *arr = new int[3]{1, 2, 3};
    cout << arr[1] << endl; // Output: 2

    // Free memory
    delete num;
    delete[] arr;

    return 0;
}
```

### **Important Notes:**

1. **Memory Leak**:

   - Occurs if you forget to use `delete` after `new`.
   - Incorrect example:
     ```cpp
     int *ptr = new int;
     // Forgot delete ptr → Memory leak!
     ```

2. **Dangling Pointer**:

   - Accessing memory after `delete` causes **undefined behavior**.
   - Incorrect example:
     ```cpp
     int *ptr = new int;
     delete ptr;
     cout << *ptr; // ERROR: Memory already freed!
     ```

3. **Difference between `delete` and `delete[]`**:
   - `delete` → For single variables.
   - `delete[]` → For arrays.

### **Modern Alternatives (Safer):**

In modern C++, prefer:

- **Smart Pointers** (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to avoid manual memory issues.
- Example:
  ```cpp
  #include <memory>
  std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(10); // No need for delete
  ```

### **Summary:**

- `new` → Allocates dynamic memory.
- `delete` → Releases memory to prevent leaks.
- **Use with caution!** Smart pointers are preferred in modern C++.
