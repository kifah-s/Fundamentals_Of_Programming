#### - " A macro in C programming language is a preprocessor directive that creates a shorthand for a long or frequently used code. Macros are defined using the #define keyword. For example, the following macro can be defined : #define PI 3.14159, This macro creates a shorthand for the value 3.14159. You can use this shorthand in your code as follows : radius = 5; area = PI * radius * radius; This code will calculate the area of a circle with a radius of 5. " ( Google Bard )

#### - " Macros in C programming language are similar to using shortcuts in the English language. For example, instead of saying "I am going home", you can say "I am going to the house". The shortcut makes the speech faster and easier to understand. Macros in C programming work in the same way. Instead of writing the same code repeatedly, you can define a macro to replace the code. This makes the code shorter and easier to read and understand. " ( Google Bard )
