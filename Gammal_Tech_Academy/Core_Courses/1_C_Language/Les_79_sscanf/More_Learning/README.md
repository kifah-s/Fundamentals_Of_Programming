1 : "The sscanf function is one of the functions used in the C programming language to extract data from a string and convert it into variable values based on format instructions. sscanf operates similarly to the scanf function but reads data from a string rather than from standard input (stdin).

The general syntax of the sscanf function is as follows:

```c
int sscanf(const char *str, const char *format, ...);
```

Where:

- str is the string from which data will be extracted.
- format is the string containing format instructions, similar to those used in scanf.
- ... allows you to add a variable number of arguments based on the format instructions in the format string.

sscanf parses the string str using the format instructions specified in format and stores the read data in the variables specified in the argument list. The data is converted into appropriate types and stored in the specified variables.

Here's a simple example of how to use sscanf:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char data[] = "John 25";
    char name[20];
    int age;

    // Using sscanf to extract data from the string
    sscanf(data, "%s %d", name, &age);

    // Printing the extracted data
    printf("Name: %s\n", name);
    printf("Age: %d\n", age);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, sscanf is used to extract a name and an age from the string data using the format instructions "%s %d", and then the extracted data is stored in the variables name and age, respectively. Finally, the extracted data is printed." **( Chat GPT )**
